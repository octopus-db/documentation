Hooghiemstra & Ran (1994) and (Andriessen et al. 1994) place the increase in Quercus pollen at ~200 ka, which compares favorably with the MIS 6/7 boundary.

An arbitrary error of ±10 ka was assigned to the MIS boundary ages.

According to these publications, the dates in Stuiver (1971) are based on the 5730-yr half-life, whereas the dates in Stuiver (1975) are based on the standard 5568-yr half-life. If this were the case, the age based on the 5730 half-life divided by the age based on the 5568-yr half-life should equal 1.0291 (5730/5568). However, the ages in Stuiver (1971) divided by the ages in Stuiver (1975) vary by a factor having the functional relationship (R-squared = 0.999): y = 0.1981*exp(-x/623.19203) - 0.04578*exp(-x/3637.31099) + 1.02369where:y = correction factorx = age in Stuiver (1971)Therefore, the ages appearing in only Stuiver (1971) have been corrrected by dividing by this correction factor.The bulk dates have a reservoir effect, which can be corrected by the varve age. However, the varve age is dependent on the estimate of missing varves at the top of the core. Craig (1969) estimated that 200 varves were missing; whereas Stuiver (1971) estimated that 600 varves were missing. Craig (1972), citing Swain pers. comm., estimated that 260 varves were missing, which appears to be the best estimate. Thus, the reservoir was estimated by subtracting the varve age from the median calibrated age (OxCal 4.2.4, IntCal13). Excepting the two upper dates, the mean reservoir is 1086 years, with little trend. The mean reservoir of the upper two dates is 781 years. These reservoirs were applied to the radiocarbon dates.Age model based on IntCal13 calibration curve.Bacon command line:Bacon('LKCLDSH',thick=5,acc.mean=20,d.max=502,depths.file=TRUE)Bacon settings file:18 #d.min502 #d.max1 #d.by1 #depths.fileNA #slump20 #acc.mean1.5 #acc.shape0.7 #mem.mean4 #mem.strengthNA #hiatus.depths1000 #hiatus.mean1 #hiatus.shape0 #BCAD1 #cc0 #postbombIntCal13 #cc1Marine13 #cc2SHCal13 #cc3ConstCal #cc4cm #unit0 #normal3 #t.a4 #t.b0 #d.R0 #d.STD0.95 #prob",NA

However, no safety pins were recovered from any burials; safety pins were patented in 1849 (Kane 1997) and presumably became fairly readily available within the next decade. Together, these artifact dates place the use of the cemetery around 1830-1850 ± 10 years, in the years just preceding the Civil War. (Lambert 2006)",NA

Radiocarbon ages were determined atBeta Analytic (Miami, USA) on micro-samples hand-picked ona stereomicroscope after sieving sediment samples through a 90-mmscreen (Table 2). Calibration of conventional radiocarbon ages tocalendar yearswas performed using the INTCAL04 database and thesoftware CALIB v5.0.1 (Stuiver et al.,1993). All ages given (expressedas years BP) refer to calibrated, calendar years before AD 1950.A linear interpolation was applied between four AMSradiocarbon dates and the lowermost 210Pb date for age-depthmodelling (Table 2; Fig. 2). A constant rate of supply model waschosen for the 210Pb chronology for both cores, as it assumesa variable sedimentation rate; 210Pb activity declines exponentially.Two replicate 14C dates from 77 cm depth are indistinguishablefrom each other; another pair of replicates at about 57 cm depthproduced one anomalously old date of 8840 years BP (Table 2). Thisdate was rejected because geological evidence indicates thatdeglaciation occurred on this part of Melville Peninsula around6650 years BP (Dredge, 1995); the material dated was likely redepositedfrom elsewhere during high energy outwash eventsassociated with deglaciation. The resulting age model produces anaverage rate of sediment accumulation since about 6000 years BP of0.12 mm/yr for Lake SP02, comparable to other small arctic lakes atsimilar latitudes (Brothers et al., 2008; Peros and Gajewski, 2009).The rate of accumulation for the most recent sediments, dated by210Pb, was higher, at 0.28 mm/yr, and the rate of sediment accumulationin the middle section of the core (the past 3000 years),was slower than the average for the core, ate0.09 mm/yr (Fig. 2).",NA

All ages given (expressedas years BP) refer to calibrated, calendar years before AD 1950.The sediment core from Lake SP04 was collected through 8 m ofwater and measured 62 cm. Activity of 210Pb decreases exponentiallyto background levels of supported 210Pb by 10 cm depth,producing a recent sediment accumulation rate of 0.88 mm/yr forthe top 10 cm of the core. Three radiocarbon dates were producedfrom the core (Table 2). Taking just the uppermost radiocarbon date(depth 23 cm) produces a rate of sediment accumulation of0.11 mm/yr for the section between it and the lowermost 210Pbdateddepth (10 cm), comparable to the late Holocene rate ofsediment accumulation for Lake SP02, providing a rationale forretaining the date from the depth of 23 cm in the age model (Fig. 3).The two-sigma ranges for the two other radiocarbon dates(depths 35.5 and 59 cm) overlap (Table 2). Sustained decreases inmagnetic susceptibility, and trends in diatom assemblages such assustained increases in the taxon Fragilaria microstriata (Fig. 5)through this section, suggest that these sediments do not representa slump or evidence for a rapid mass wasting event. The sedimentsin this section consist of fine-grained gyttja, with no evidence forsharp changes in grain size, organic matter content, mineralogy ordiatom assemblages. Changes in all or some of those variableswould be expected if this section was a product of a rapid masswasting event. Therefore, we chose to retain one of the two overlappingradiocarbon dates.The rate of sediment accumulation between the date at thedepth of 35.5 cm and date at the depth of 23 cm (which we haveaccepted) is 0.72 mm/yr, comparable to reported rates for otherlakes of similar size at similar latitude (Brothers et al., 2008). Thisrate is higher than observed in Lake SP02, but the recent rate ofsediment accumulation (in the 210Pb-dated section of the core) issimilarly higher for Lake SP04 relative to SP02. The rate of sedimentaccumulation between the date at the depth of 59 cm and the dateat the depth of 23 cm (which we have accepted) is 1.38 mm/yr. This rate of sediment accumulation exceeds the recent rate, and is anorder of magnitude higher than reports of rates of sediment accumulationfor small arctic lakes (e.g., Peros and Gajewski, 2009).Therefore, we developed an age model using the radiocarbon datesobtained at depths 23 cm and 35.5 cm only. We conclude that thedate at 59 cm is anomalously young, and may have resulted frombioturbation or contamination during coring. We acknowledge theuncertainties in the chronology for core SP04 for sediments olderthan 1240 years BP, therefore the biostratigraphic data are plottedas a function of depth (Fig. 5).",NA

Activities of total 210Pb, 226Ra, 137Cs, and 241Am were measured simultaneously by gamma spectrometry (Baskaran and Naidu 1995; Fuller et al. 1999; Van Metre and Fuller 2009) on homogenized freeze-dried samples at the US Geological Survey Sediment Radioisotope Laboratory in Menlo Park, California.  .... Total 210Pb was determined from the 46 keV gamma emission line, with the supported 210Pb activity, defined by the 226Ra activity, determined on each section from the 352 keV and 609 keV gamma emission lines of the short-lived daughters 214Pb and 214Bi, respectively. ...  ... The measured activities of replicate analysis of material from the same sample agreed to within ± 15%....  Conifer needles from three depths were pre-treated for 14C analysis in the University of Nevada, Reno Human Paleoecology and Archaeometry Lab, following the acid-base-acid (ABA) method. ...  The pretreated CO2 samples were then submitted to the 14C lab at Penn State University for the final stage of processing and generation of 14C dates. An age-depth model was constructed using 210Pb and 14C data and the software package Plum (Aquino-Lo´pez et al. 2018).

Independent, resolved varve counts by two researchers were completed on individual drives from both cores (~1 m long), and for smaller sections between marker beds (~5 cm long). If sections delineated by marker beds were present where both core sequences overlapped, error estimates were calculated using four varve counts (by each researcher and per core; Table 1). Based on the differences in varve counts, the estimated chronological error for individual drives ranged from 1.5% to 6.7%. When varve counts were replicated between distinct marker beds, the estimated error was 1.4–4.1%. Counts were therefore within a normal margin of error for a varve chronology (Renberg 1983, Ojala et al. 2012). ... An independent Bayesian age-depth model was generated using AMS 14C dating of 22 evenly distributed samples throughout the cores in order to validate the varve chronology ... The two chronologies were very similar, only deviating from each other slightly between 1.0 and 2.3 m, and again from 3.5 to 4.5 m. The maximum difference between the mean age of the 14C-based chronology and varve age at any given depth was <500 yr.

OCTOPUS database documentation
==============================

**OCTOPUS** (`https://octopusdata.org <https://octopusdata.org>`_) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database that allows users to visualise, query, and download cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, luminescence, and radiocarbon ages and denudation rates associated with erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms and archaeological records, along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

OCTOPUS is non-commercial, non-profit, and least restrictively licensed. The main purpose of OCTOPUS is the sustainment, upcycling and public provisioning of valuable legacy data that would otherwise be lost to the research community. Beyond research, the promotion and implementation of Indigenous self-management, public training and education are declared OCTOPUS focus target scopes.

**Acknowledgement**. OCTOPUS database is supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH) [#]_. Funding was also provided by the University of Wollongong [#]_ and the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), now part of the Australian Research Data Commons [#]_. Selection and compostition of attribute fields for the individual sub-collections is the collective effort of expert panels, whose contributing individuals are named in the :ref:`Data collections` section. Not least, shaping and maintining OCTOPUS v.2 benefited from the liberal knowledge transfer and advice of Jessica Blois, Simon Goring, Eric C. Grimm, and John W. (Jack) Williams (in alph. order).

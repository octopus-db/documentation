Abbuehl:2010peruvian,"High magnitude precipitation events provide large contributions to landscape formation and surface denudation in arid environments. Here, we quantify the precipitation-dependent geomorphic processes within the Rio Piura drainage basin located on the Western Escarpment of the northern Peruvian Andes at 5°S latitude. In this region, monsoonal easterly winds bring precipitation to the > 3000 m asl high headwaters, from where the annual amount of precipitation decreases downstream toward the Pacific coast. Denudation rates are highest in the knickzones near the headwaters, ~ 200–300 mm ky− 1, and sediment discharge is limited by the transport capacity of the channel network. Every few years, this situation is perturbed by westerly, wind-driven heavy precipitation during El Niño events and results in supply-limited sediment discharge as indicated by bedrock channels. ...

Abrahami:2016sikkim,"Understanding the relative strengths of tectonic and climatic forcing on erosion at different spatial and temporal scales is important to understand the evolution of orogenic topography. To address this question, we quantified exhumation rates at geological timescales and erosion rates at millennial timescales in modern river sands from 10 sub-catchments of the Tista River drainage basin in the Sikkim Himalaya (northeast India) using detrital apatite fission-track thermochronology and cosmogenic 10Be analyses, respectively. We compare these rates to several potential geomorphic or climatic forcing parameters. Our results show that millennial erosion rates are generally higher and spatially more variable than long-term exhumation rates in Sikkim. They also show strongly contrasting spatial patterns, suggesting that the processes controlling these rates are decoupled. ...

Acosta:201vegetation,"The mechanisms by which climate and vegetation affect erosion rates over various time scales lie at the heart of understanding landscape response to climate change. Plot-scale field experiments show that increased vegetation cover slows erosion, implying that faster erosion should occur under low to moderate vegetation cover. However, demonstrating this concept over long time scales and across landscapes has proven to be difficult, especially in settings complicated by tectonic forcing and variable slopes. We investigate this problem by measuring cosmogenic 10Be-derived catchment-mean denudation rates across a range of climate zones and hillslope gradients in the Kenya Rift, and by comparing our results with those published from the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda. We find that denudation rates from sparsely vegetated parts of the Kenya Rift are up to 0.13 mm/yr, while those from humid and more densely vegetated parts of the Kenya Rift flanks and the Rwenzori Mountains reach a maximum of 0.08 mm/yr, despite higher median hillslope gradients. While differences in lithology and recent land-use changes likely affect the denudation rates and vegetation cover values in some of our studied catchments, hillslope gradient and vegetation cover appear to explain most of the variation in denudation rates across the study area. Our results support the idea that changing vegetation cover can contribute to complex erosional responses to climate or land-use change and that vegetation cover can play an important role in determining the steady-state slopes of mountain belts through its stabilizing effects on the land surface.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adams:2016bhutan,"Prior studies have proposed tectonic and climatic mechanisms to explain surface uplift throughout the Bhutan Himalaya. While the resulting enigmatic, low‐relief landscapes, elevated above deeply incised canyons, are a popular setting to test ideas of interacting tectonic and climatic forces, when and why these landscapes formed is still debated. We test the idea that these landscapes were created by a spatially variable and recent increase in rock uplift rate associated with the formation of structural duplexes at depth. We utilize a new suite of erosion rates derived from detrital cosmogenic nuclide techniques, geomorphic observations, and a landscape evolution model to demonstrate the viability of this hypothesis. Low‐relief landscapes in Bhutan are eroding at a rate of ~70 m/Ma, while basins from surrounding steep landscapes yield erosion rates of ~950 m/Ma, demonstrating that this portion of the range is in a transient period of increasing relief. Applying insights from our erosion rates, we explore the influence of an active duplex on overlying topography using a landscape evolution model by imposing a high rock uplift rate in the middle of a mountain range. Our simulations show that low‐relief landscapes with thick alluvial fills form upstream of convex knickpoints as rivers adjust to higher uplift rates downstream, a pattern consistent with geologic, geomorphic, and thermochronometric data from Bhutan. With our new erosion rates, reconstructed paleo‐river profiles, and landscape evolution simulations, we show that the low‐relief landscapes were formed in situ as they were uplifted ~800 m in the past ~0.8–1 Ma.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adams:2018holocene,"Recent work has highlighted a strong, worldwide, alpine glacial impact on orogen erosion rates over the last 2 Ma. While it may be assumed that glaciers increased erosion rates when active, the degree to which past glaciations influence Holocene erosion rates through the adjustment of topography is not known. In this study, we investigate the influence of long-term tectonic and post-glacial topographic controls on erosion in a glaciated orogen: the Olympic Mountains, USA. We present 14 new 10Be and 26Al analyses which constrain Holocene erosion rates across the Olympic Mountains. Basin-averaged erosion rates scale with basin-averaged values of 5 km local relief, channel steepness, and hillslope angle throughout the range, similar to observations from non-glaciated orogens. These erosion rates are not related to mean annual precipitation or the marked change in Pleistocene alpine glacier size across the range, implying that glacier modification of topography and modern precipitation parameters do not exert strong controls on these rates. Rather, we find that despite spatial variations in glacial modification of topography, patterns of recent erosion are similar to those from estimates of long-term tectonic rock uplift. This is consistent with a tectonic model where erosion and rock uplift patterns are controlled by the deformation of the Cascadia subduction zone.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adams:2020climate,"The ongoing debate about the nature of coupling between climate and tectonics in mountain ranges derives, in part, from an imperfect understanding of how topography, climate, erosion, and rock uplift are interrelated. Here, we demonstrate that erosion rate is nonlinearly related to fluvial relief with a proportionality set by mean annual rainfall. These relationships can be quantified for tectonically active landscapes, and calculations based on them enable estimation of erosion where observations are lacking. Tests of the predictive power of this relationship in the Himalaya, where erosion is well constrained, affirm the value of our approach. Our model allows estimation of erosion rates in fluvial landscapes using readily available datasets, and the underlying relationship between erosion and rainfall offers the promise of a deeper understanding of how climate and tectonic evolution affect erosion and topography in space and time and of the potential influence of climate on tectonics.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adams:2020community,"Bioarchaeological research in Australia has lagged behind that in other regions due to understandable concerns arising from the disregard of Indigenous Australians rights over their ancestors‘ remains. To improve this situation, bioarchaeologists working in Australia need to employ more community-oriented approaches to research. This paper reports a project in which we employed such an approach. The project focused on burials in the Flinders Group, Queensland. Traditional Owners played a key role in the excavations and helped devise analyses that would deliver both scientific contributions and socially relevant outcomes. The fieldwork and laboratory analyses yielded a number of interesting results. Most significantly, they revealed that the pattern of mortuary practices recorded by ethnographers in the region in the early 20th century - complex burial of powerful people and simple interment of less important individuals - has a time depth of several hundred years or more. More generally, the project shows that there can be fruitful collaboration between archaeologists and Indigenous communities in relation to the excavation and scientific analysis of Aboriginal ancestral remains.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adeleye:2021bridge,"The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) remains an enigmatic period in southeast Australia due to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of its palaeoclimatic records. A major feature of the LGM landscape was the existence of the Bassian Land Bridge, joining Tasmania with the mainland of Australia during periods of low sea level, and potentially facilitating increased biotic movement between these regions. To better understand biogeographical changes on the land bridge and in southeast Australia generally during the LGM, we present a 35 ka-year palaeoecological record from one of the larger islands of Bass Strait.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Adeleye:2021furneaux,"Indigenous land use and climate have shaped fire regimes in southeast Australia during the Holocene, although their relative influence remains unclear. The archaeologically attested mid-Holocene decline in land-use intensity on the Furneaux Group islands (FGI) relative to mainland Tasmanian and SE Australia presents a natural experiment to identify the roles of climate and anthropogenic land use. We reconstruct two key facets of regional fire regimes, biomass (vegetation) burned (BB) and recurrence rate of fire episodes (RRFE), by using total charcoal influx and charcoal peaks in palaeoecological records, respectively. Our results suggest climate-driven biomass accumulation and dryness-controlled BB across southeast Australia during the Holocene. Insights from the FGI suggest people elevated the recurrence rate of fire episodes through frequent cultural burning during the early Holocene and reduction in recurrent Indigenous cultural burning during the mid--late Holocene led to increases in BB. These results provide long-term evidence of the effectiveness of Indigenous cultural burning in reducing biomass burned and may be effective in stabilizing fire regimes in flammable landscapes in the future.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Adeleye:2022thesis,"Global change poses a major threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. This is particularly evident in southeast Australia, where never-before-seen wildfires are associated with ecosystem destruction, as well as loss of wildlife, human lives and infrastructures. In order to tackle these challenges, there is a need for better understanding of long-term ecosystem changes in the region. This understanding will help in building robust knowledge baselines for management and restoration goals. The Bass Strait islands (BSI) provide a rare opportunity to investigate the long-term roles of climate and human land use in driving ecosystem and fire regime changes, due to their unique history of human occupation, which contrasts with surrounding southeast Australian regions. The BSI saw declining populations at the same time as population intensification occurred in southeast (SE) Australia in the mid-late Holocene. The BSI can thus be regarded as rare natural laboratories where climatic and anthropogenic drivers of long-term ecological dynamics can be disentangled. The knowledge of the different roles of climate and anthropogenic land use on ecosystems and fire regimes gained from these natural laboratories can be applied to areas of SE Australia to inform management strategies in an era of significant ecological changes. Therefore, this thesis provides a deeper understanding of past links between ecosystem change, changes in climate, fire regimes, and human land use in SE Australia, using the Bass Strait area as a case study. Specific questions addressed include, (1) What drove vegetation and wetland changes in SE Australia during the last glacial and Holocene? (2) What was the role of humans in vegetation and fire-regime changes in SE Australia during the Holocene? (3) How can this deep-time knowledge contribute to better managing the ecosystems and fire regimes of the BSI and SE Australia at large? In order to answer these questions, multiple wetland sediment cores were analysed to reconstruct vegetation, fire, and wetland histories of one of the least researched BSI (i.e. truwana/Cape Barren Island) and compared to existing palaeoecological records from neighbouring regions of SE Australian mainland and Tasmania. The thesis places these findings into a broader regional context, by analysing changes in vegetation and fire regimes and associated drivers of change across SE Australia, applying a quantitative approach for the first time. The results suggest that climate primarily drove ecosystem change across SE Australian region in the last ~35,000 years. Specifically, temperature change and shifts in Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) were key drivers of vegetation and wetland changes during the last glacial period, while sea-level change, and precipitation changes related to El Nino Southern Oscillation and SWW were more important during the Holocene. Indigenous people used fire to maintain open and diverse woodlands during the Holocene, and a combination of climate and anthropogenic land use controlled Holocene fire regimes across SE Australia. On a finer spatial scale, insights from the BSI suggest Indigenous frequent burning reduced the area burnt by climate-driven fires during the Holocene. Indigenous fire management minimized contiguous woody fuel accumulation over the landscape, which in turn reduced fire spread. The suppression of Indigenous cultural fire management by European colonisation, combined with climate change, created novel fire regimes in SE Australia in the last 200 years. The reinstatement of an Indigenous cultural burning approach is recommended to help reduce the occurrence of destructive fires in SE Australian forests and to preserve rare ecosystems, such as heathlands. This will help in restoring ecosystem health and biocultural heritage in SE Australia. Monitoring of wetland hydrology and salinity is also recommended to preserve wetlands of significant ecological values in Bass Strait and the wider region.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Adeleye:2023moorland,"Context: The primary factors(s) responsible for the maintenance of Alternative biome states (ABS) in world forest biomes remains unclear and debatable, partly due to insufficient long-term ecological data from suitable ecosystem sites. The occurrence of moorland in southern and western Tasmanian wet temperate forest presents a suitable setting to test for ABS and understand the main stabilizing factors of ABS. Objectives: We use a palaeoecological approach to test for ABS and identify the degree of vegetation change and the effect of climate change and fire occurrence associated with ABS in southern Tasmania. Methods: Sediment sequence from sink-hole lake in a forest and nearby pond in southern Tasmania were analysed for pollen and charcoal to reconstruct histories of forest, moorland and fire in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA). Reconstructions were compared to palaeoclimate record. Results: Moorland and forest in southern Tasmania have occupied the same habitat for at least the last 2600 years, and neither past climate change nor fire occurrence affected the stability of the vegetation mosaic. We suspect that localized environmental settings, such as topography and edaphic conditions are the primary stabilizing factors of the forest-moorland mosaics. Conclusions: The observed stable vegetation mosaics in our study is contrary to the dominant ecological paradigm of landscape dynamics currently used to manage the TWWHA, and there is a need to refine the ecological basis of fire management in the area. Similar targeted palaeoecological studies are needed to fully understand the underlying factors responsible for the persistence of treeless vegetation in world forest biomes.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Aguilar:2014huasco,"Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in sediment are used to quantify mean denudation rates in catchments. This article explores the differences between the 10Be concentration in fine (sand) and in coarse (1–3 or 5–10 cm pebbles) river sediment. Sand and pebbles were sampled at four locations in the Huasco Valley, in the arid Chilean Andes. Sand has 10Be concentrations between 4.8 and 8.3·105 at g−1, while pebbles have smaller concentrations between 2.2 and 3.3·105 at g−1. It appears that the different concentrations, systematically measured between sand and pebbles, are the result of different denudation rates, linked with the geomorphologic processes that originated them. We propose that the 10Be concentrations in sand are determined by the mean denudation rate of all of the geomorphologic processes taking place in the catchment, including debris flow processes as well as slower processes such as hill slope diffusion. In contrast, the concentrations in pebbles are probably related to debris flows occurring in steep slopes. The mean denudation rates calculated in the catchment are between 30 and 50 m/Myr, while the denudation rates associated with debris flow are between 59 and 81 m/Myr. These denudation rates are consistent with those calculated using different methods, such as measuring eroded volumes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Aird:2020thesis,"The existing state of the Earth and all living organisms in it, are defined by ways in which socioecological interactions have set trajectories in past and present contexts. Our ongoing survival depends on how socio-ecological interactions materialise into the future. In many societies, this theme has been the subject of rigorous debate, shaped political views and relationships, influenced the trade and exchange of resources, fuelled the insertion of borders, and is built into multi-generational knowledge systems. But seldom are long-term repositories of knowledge satisfactorily considered for holistic interpretations to plan for the future. Modern socio-ecological knowledge is important, although, the dilemma we experience in making sense of 'best stewardship' is the conundrum of shifting baseline understandings. Increasingly, baseline understandings deriving from deep time cultural contexts are being used to overcome this challenge in different parts of the world. Never has this approach been adopted for cases within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) World Heritage region in Australia. At coastal sites along the length of the GBR, many cultural deep time sites exist. The material remains in these repositories comprise of ecologically and culturally important marine fauna. However key data that are directly extractable from these materials has not been prioritised to inform conservation practitioner teams.  ...

Aitken:1993cranbourne,"The vegetation of the Cranbourne Botanic Garden has shown substantial changes during the Holocene due to the influences of climate, sea level rise, fire and, recently, European people. The earliest recorded phase, prior to 8,500 years BP, was characterised by ephemeral swamps and Casuarina-dom'mated dry-land communities. Climatic amelioration after this time is indicated by the establishment of permanent swamp conditions and an increase in Eucalyptus within the regional vegetation. Highest available moisture levels occurred between about 7,000 and 5,000 years ago as a result of increased effective precipitation and the attainment of high sea levels towards the end of the post-glacial marine transgression. Casuarina communities declined abruptly and were partially replaced by tall open eucalypt forests with a substantial amount of the wet sclerophyll taxon Pomaderris in the understorey. Increased climatic variability and burning within the last 5,000 years has led to the development of a diverse vegetation dominated by sclerophyll woodlands and heath which has been subsequently modified by European activities. These changes provide some basis for understanding the present nature and stability of the vegetation and should contribute to the formulation of future management practices.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

A midden on this island exhibits the high density of bone typical of middens on New South Wales offshore islands, but in this case it is a large migratory fruit bat (Pteropus poliocephalue) rather than bird that is specifically exploited. Initial analysis of a small test excavation has revealed a change in the midden composition which would appear to indicate a change in the pattern of exploitation. Independent evidence appears to exist for a build-up of the mudflats between the mainland and the island, and the resultant increase in littoral resources, together with easier access to the island, is offered as an explanation for the variation in the midden composition.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Allen:1969phd,"This thesis is an investigation into the use of archaeology as a technique for widening the range of historical evidence in the recent past. It records the first professional excavations of a European site in Australia, Port Essington in the Northern Territory. Consequently chapters 2 - 5 are concerned with describing the excavations and architecture remaining at Port Essington, and the methods and results of the analysis of a body of artifacts of types which have not been rul adequately described (at least in archaeological terms) elsewhere. The main object of this protracted analysis is to take full advantage of the unique opportunities of the site which was occupied for only eleven years and which has remained largely undisturbed since, thus providing a closely dated context for the artifacts which were recovered. A second major area of enquiry in this section is the analysis of an Aboriginal assemblage of implements made from bottle glass obtained from the European settlement.The implications of this collection are several: 1. It is the archaeological reflection of the impact of the Europeans upon the indigenous people. 2.It supports a hypothesis that the reasons for the non-manufacture of stone implements in the coastal regions of Arnhem Land may simply be explained as one of environmental determinism rather than cultural preference. 3. It adds important new information for the discussion of glass artifacts found elsewhere in the world. The second section is a brief history of the settlement. Chapter 6 examines the reasons for the establishment of Port Essington and suggests that the commercial reasons suggested by previous historians may be less important than the political considerations behind the establishment. Chapters 7 and 8 relate the history of the settlement, chapter 8 introducing the archaeological data as historical evidence. Chapter 9 suggests that following the discussion in chapter 6, Port Essington might well be regarded as a success rather than the failure it is generally considered to have been. The final chapter discusses the value of archaeology as a research tool for the recent historical past.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Allen:1972darling,"The Darling River, the second largest in eastern Australia, flows through an area of semi-arid grassland. The presence of the river in this dry region created a highly favourable environment for Aboriginal inhabitants. Historical descriptions of these Aborigines, mostly written in the late nineteenth century, show the Darling River as the single most important human resource in the Darling Basin. These records provide some evidence that the Bagundji Aborigines of the Darling basin moved from the narrow river margin into the drier hinterland and back again. These movements coincide with discernable seasonal climatic fluctuations. The majority of archaeological sites so far discovered in the Darling Basin are clustered around the shores of lakes. Some of these lakes have not been filled with water for the past 15,000 years. Analysis of these lakeside sites, dated back as far as 26,000 B.P, reveal that the prehistoric Aborigines exploited the Darling Basin in a similar manner to that described for the historic Aborigines. Stone implements recovered from the older sites are similar to those recovered from younger sites, such as Burke’s Cave, in the same region. This is taken as indicating that the inhabitants of the Basin have shared a single cultural tradition from the late Pleistocene to the ethnographic present.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

A majority of scientists now agree people were present at least by 45,000 years ago, but many still argue for dates up to and beyond 60,000 years ago. The long chronology continues to be driven by the five well-known sites of Nauwalabila, Malakunanja, Huon Peninsula, Lake Mungo and Devil’s Lair. This paper reviews the data which have appeared for these sites over the last decade. It argues that uncertainty over much of the earliest data stems from questions of artefact context and site taphonomy rather than dating technologies.

They are interpreted within the context of ethnographic observations and information from Arnhem Land archaeological sites of a comparable age, particularly those combining archaeology with rock art research. The study shows convergence between the archaeology, rock art and ethnography, indicating the importance of spears in the life of Aboriginal people, in this case reed spears and spears with barbed heads.

Allen:2023legacy,"Ngaut Ngaut (Devon Downs) and Tungawa (Fromm's Landing) 2 and 6 are located in the Gorge Section of the Lower Murray River. They were excavated more than 60 years ago. Unusually, they preserved fauna over the 6000 or 7000 years of occupation. Assessing this record, it is concluded that Aboriginal agents were responsible for the middens in these rockshelters. Following this, Ngaut Ngaut and the Tungawa sites are compared in terms of their dating, stratigraphy and changes in the fauna through time. While the majority of species are present throughout at all three sites, there are shifts in the number of animals in concert with Holocene environmental changes. After 3000 BP, the trend is to increased attention being given to resources from the riparian and river zones and away from the dryland Murray Plains. An increase in shellfish and the presence of crayfish gastroliths support this contention. Nearby Tartanga Island provides a record of Holocene sedimentary changes in the Murray River associated with altered sea level and flood regimes, particularly the deposition of the Monoman and Coonambidgal formations. The latter creating a landscape of highly productive swamps and backwaters. The information from these legacy excavations supports the conclusion that a shift in the locus of Aboriginal hunting and gathering activities accompanied mid- and late-Holocene environmental changes on the Lower Murray River.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
Allison:2006strategy,"In the coastal heathlands of southern Victoria, populations of a rare dasyurid, the swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus maritimus), are restricted to small and disjunct patches of suitable habitat. Although characteristics of their preferred habitat in terms of vegetation structure and composition have been described, little is known of their diet preferences. Diet and food availability of the species was examined at two coastal and two inland sites, during winter and spring by way of faecal analyses and pitfall trapping. Only minor differences in diet were observed between the coastal and inland habitats and this was consistent across season. There was, however, variation in food availability between the two habitat types, with generally higher frequencies of invertebrates occurring within the inland than in the coastal habitat during spring. Even so, when diet was directly compared with food availability, the differences observed within individual categories within each season were similar in magnitude and direction for both habitats, suggesting that inland and coastal populations of the swamp antechinus have similar dietary strategies. Insect larvae, Diplopoda and Coleoptera appeared to be favoured dietary items being almost consistently over-represented in the diet compared to their availability, whereas Collembola, Amphipoda, Dermaptera and Formicidae were avoided as they were never consumed in proportion to their availability. Although dietary preferences were evident, there was no clear selection of any one particular prey item, and so the swamp antechinus was considered a dietary generalist. Also, as the species sampled from most of the range of prey items available to them, it fits the qualitative criterion of opportunism. The generalist strategy of the swamp antechinus is likely to be advantageous in an environment subject to disturbance.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,

The paper covers sampling and conservation, dating (including new information on the local oceanic reservoir effect), distribution, art, depositional and cultural histories. These distinctive Conus shell valuables are part of the material culture found along the northern coast of the eastern tip of New Guinea and on the islands of the northern Massim during the Expansion Phase c.1000–500 BP. Their decoration is comparable to that produced by Milne Bay Province woodcarvers in historic times.

Ames:2020grassridge,"Grassridge rock shelter is located in the high elevation grassland foothills of the Stormberg Mountains in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. This places Grassridge at an important biogeoclimatic intersection between the Drakensberg Mountains, the South African coastal zone, and the interior arid lands of southern Africa. First excavated in 1979, the approximately 1.5 m stratigraphic sequence was divided into two major occupational components: a 50–70 cm thick Later Stone Age component dating between 7–6 ka and an underlying 50–80 cm thick Middle Stone Age component dated to 36 ka at the base. Here we present a reanalysis of the Grassridge stratigraphic sequence that combines new optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon age estimates with sedimentological and microbotanical analyses to evaluate site formation processes and the palaeoenvironmental context of human occupations. Results indicate a complex history of geogenic, anthropogenic, and biogenic inputs to the depositional sequence that are interspersed with pulsed human occupation from 43–28 ka, 13.5–11.6 ka, and 7.3–6.8 ka. Microbotanical remains indicate a cooler, drier grassland environment in MIS 3 that transitions to a warmer, moister grassland environment dominated by summer rainfall in the middle of MIS 1. The pulsed occupational sequence identified at Grassridge is characteristic of the Pleistocene and Holocene record across the greater high elevation grassland region of South Africa, which, based on comparison with other currently available evidence, seems linked to a complex system of forager mobility entwined with rapidly fluctuating palaeoenvironments across the last glacial to interglacial transition.",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,

I show that the dataset derived from the interpolation of rain gauge data performs best in the Himalayas. I demonstrate the importance of an until now unconsidered, major compartment of the Himalayan discharge cycle, which I identify as a fractured basement aquifer, and estimate the snow and ice melt contribution to the Himalayan rivers. Erosion rates calculated from suspended sediment fluxes and cosmogenic nuclide analysis range between 0.1 and 4 mm/yr. The rivers in the Nepal Himalayas are supply limited and the hillslopes as contributing source are transport limited.

Extensive lithic artefact scatters, featuring diverse materials and forms, span a large alluvial terrace beside a meander bend at the base of the valley. As well as documenting the abundant artefacts present on the surface and at shallow depths below ground, a mechanical excavation clarified the geomorphology of the terrace and verified the presence of deeply buried cultural deposits.

Riverbanks and their wider floodplains were repeatedly inhabited as hunting and fishing grounds and to gather plants and other materials; moreover, Aboriginal people used rivers and creeks as routeways and landmarks to navigate Country, for meetings and ceremonies, to affirm boundaries and territorial claims; and they were sacred features whose origins were captured in stories and songs. Archaeological investigations often encounter material that hints at persistent occupation of riverine landforms, but it is rare to conclusively prove the overall duration that a place was inhabited and the length of occupation episodes.

While numerous studies have focused on the Longmen Shan frontal range to constrain the dynamics of the eastern Tibetan margin, little is known on the LFS, particularly on its eventual influence on the geomorphological evolution of the latter. Here, we provide a new data set of denudation rates derived from beryllium-10 concentrations in river sediments from 33 medium-sized catchments. Our sampling area covers the frontier between the dissected margin and the low relief interior plateau. Our results reveal a sharp increase of denudation across the LFS, from < 0.1 mm/y in the Ruoergai basin to 0.3 mm/y toward the Longmen Shan range. Such denudation pattern indicates a major morphotectonic control of the fault system on the eastern Tibetan margin evolution. Additional topographic analysis confirms the role of the LFS as an important geomorphological boundary, restraining the westward propagation of river incision into the low-relief areas, thus partly preventing the dismantling of the eastern Tibetan Plateau.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Anson:1983thesis,"This thesis undertakes an analysis of the decoration and composition of largely unpublished Lapita pottery from the Watom, Ambitle, Talasea and Eloaue sites in the Bismarck Archipelago. The composition of other pottery types which were found at Watom and may be related to Lapita is also analysed. The purpose of these analyses is to study the inter-relationship of this pottery and of the sites in which it was discovered. With the aim of attempting extra-mural comparisons, pottery decoration analysis has been broadened to include pottery decoration from other Lapita sites to the east outside the Bismarck Archipelago. The method adopted to compare the decoration of the pottery consists of a quantitative analysis of 516 ungrouped decorative motifs from 16 sites or collections (Table XII). It is considered that the method adopted improves upon earlier analyses of this type. An analytical innovation was the use of an Electron Microprobe which enabled a distinction to be made between the compostion of intra-assemblage pottery types at Watom. The study of Lapita pottery decoration reveals the existence of a third Lapita province which is earlier than the Western and Eastern Lapita provinces already proposed. site niteraction in this Far Western Lapita province is then studied more closely through the comparison of the composition of pottery which is found there.

Antcliff:1988emsin,"Research into the prehistory of the Bismarck Archipelago draws upon a number of sources of information including archaeology, linguistics and biological anthropology. However, the information provided by the first discipline usually takes precedence when attempting to define the prehistory of the region. Thus it is not possible for linguistic evidence to determine when a particular island or region was first occupied: linguistic reconstructions are an attempt to approach the past by examining the present. Evidence for the antiquity of occupation of a particular place may only be revealed securely by archaeology. Although there are now some points of consensus between scholars in these disciplines (e.g. there was some sort of movement of people speaking Austronesian languages assoiated with the introduction of Lapita pottery), it should be noted that the evidence provided by these three related disciplines dos not always correlate exactly. Thus in the 1983 volume of the Journal of Human Evolution a linguist proposes a sequence for different migrations to New Guinea and Island Western Melanesia (Wurm, 1983), while a number of biological anthropologists (e.g. Rhoads, 1983; Sarjeanston et al., 1983) argue that the evidence of various gene frequencies is not suggestive of a one-to-one relationship between the language of groups and their ethnic affinities.

For while the environmental history of this biome is relatively well known, at least since the termination of the last glaciation at c. 16,000 BP (e.g. Kershaw and Strickland 1989; Martin 1999; Barrows et al. 2001; Hope 2003; Kershaw et al. 2007), evidence of human activity above 1000 m elevation currently extends back no further than 4000 years (Flood 1980; Kamminga 1992, 1995; Lourandos 1997; Mulvaney and Kamminga 1999).

AquinoLopez:2018plum,"In studies of environmental change of the past few centuries, 210Pb dating is often used to obtain chronologies for sedimentary sequences. One of the most commonly used approaches to estimate the age of material at different depths in a sequence is to assume a constant rate of supply (CRS) or influx of 'unsupported' 210Pb from the atmosphere, together with a constant or varying amount of 'supported' 210Pb. Current 210Pb dating models do not use a proper statistical framework and provide poor estimates of the uncertainties. Here, we develop a new model for 210Pb dating, where ages and values of supported and unsupported 210Pb form part of the parameters. We apply our model to a case study from Canada as well as to some simulated examples. Our model can extend beyond the current CRS approach, deal with asymmetric errors and mix 210Pb with other types of dating, thus obtaining more robust, realistic and statistically better defined age estimates.",2023-06-16 09:01:12.578 +0200,2023-06-16 09:01:12.578 +0200

Arkle:2017trinidad,"Cosmogenic 10Be measured in sediments from Northern Range catchments on the island of Trinidad reveals low millennial-scale rates of erosion (average ~ 40 mm/ka) that increase roughly eightfold, from 11 to 92 mm/ka, eastward across the mountain range. These results, in conjunction with an analysis of mountain morphometrics, are consistent with Quaternary east-side-up tilting of the Northern Range, which has occurred recently (~ 100 ka). The highest millennial-scale erosion rates coincide spatially with Quaternary east-side surface uplift (albeit not in magnitude), high modern rainfall rates, low topographic relief, and convex longitudinal stream profiles, indicating transient Quaternary erosion. We interpret that hillslope adjustment and erosion of the Northern Range is buffered from climatic and tectonic forcings by dense tropical vegetation cover, thick saprolite, and porous regolith. Compared with longer-term, thermochronology exhumation rates, we document that an order of magnitude deceleration of and reversal in the locus of erosion and exhumation has occurred during the Pliocene to the Holocene. We suggest that these combined data sets highlight distinct syn- and post-collisional phases of Northern Range development that are related to a major change in relative Caribbean-South American plate motion from oblique convergence to transform motion. Oblique collision during the mid-Miocene likely caused relatively higher rates of and asymmetric exhumation of the Northern Range.

Armitage:1998radiocarbon,"Indirect dating methods have been applied to the rock paintings of Chillagoe, north Queensland, revealing patterns of superimposition, depictions of items of known antiquity, the use of fragile paints such as mud, and in-situ pigment stratigraphies (David 1994). These patterns suggest that the Chillagoe rock paintings are relatively young, likely less than 3000 years old. A change in the geographical distribution of rock painting styles suggests a regionalization of the styles starting around 3000 years BP. Such regionalization implies that major cultural changes accompanied the changes in rock painting styles. This model of temporal change is now being investigated through a collaboration between the University of Queensland, ANSTO and the Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University to directly analyze radiocarbon in the charcoal pigments in several of the Chillagoe rock paintings Samples were collected from fourteen separate charcoal rock drawings at five rock shelters in the Chillagoe region. A small area of each drawing was scraped using a sterile scalpel blade and the material was collected on a square of aluminum foil. The resulting powder was a mixture of limestone substrate, charcoal pigment and overlying accretion. Latex gloves were worn when sampling and when handling the foil to prevent contamination. Enclosed in the foil, each sample was placed in a zipper-seal polyethylene bag, carefully labeled and brought back to the laboratory at Texas A&M University. They were then photographed under magnification and weighed after foreign debris (fabric fibers, etc.) were removed; weights ranged from 9 to 66 milligrams of total material. One sample weighing 263 milligrams was to be divided for duplicate analysis. Typically, 100 micrograms of carbon is sufficient for radiocarbon analysis by AMS.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Arnold:2019bleaching,"Previous assessments of thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) signal resetting in natural sedimentary settings have been based on relatively limited numbers of observations, and have been conducted primarily at the multi-grain scale of equivalent dose (De) analysis. In this study, we undertake a series of single-grain TT-OSL bleaching assessments on nineteen modern and geological dating samples from different sedimentary environments. Daylight bleaching experiments performed over several weeks confirm that single-grain TT-OSL signals are optically reset at relatively slow, and potentially variable, rates. Single-grain TT-OSL residual doses range between 0 and 24 Gy for thirteen modern samples, with >50% of these samples yielding weighted mean De values of 0 Gy at 2σ. Single-grain OSL and TT-OSL dating comparisons performed on well-bleached and heterogeneously bleached late Pleistocene samples from Kangaroo Island, South Australia, yield consistent replicate age estimates. Our results reveal that (i) single-grain TT-OSL residuals can potentially be reduced down to insignificant levels when compared with the natural dose range of interest for most TT-OSL dating applications; (ii) the slow bleaching properties of TT-OSL signals may not necessarily limit their dating applicability to certain depositional environments; and (iii) non-trivial differences may be observed between single-grain and multi-grain TT-OSL bleaching residuals in some modern samples. Collectively, these findings suggest that single-grain TT-OSL dating may offer advantages over multi-grain TT-OSL dating in certain complex depositional environments.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Ash:2014thesis,"This thesis is an archaeological examination of the colonial history of the Mualgal people (the Indigenous people of Mua, western Torres Strait, northeastern Australia) from their first entanglements with the London Missionary Society in the late nineteenth century, to their later supposed ‘absorption‘ into the Queensland State bureaucracy following the turn of the twentieth century. The two case studies considered - Totalai and Poid - are seminal ancestral village sites for the Mualgal today. They offer a rare opportunity for researchers to examine changing Mualgal traditions of the colonial era with relatively fine-grained temporal resolution. Occupation of each village during this colonial period was short (although an even earlier village at Totalai has a pre-colonial antiquity) and relates to a different phase in Torres Strait’s colonial history: the indirect ‘rule‘ of the LMS years (c.1871 - 1904) and the colonial authority of the Queensland Government Protectors (c.1904 - 1950).",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In this paper, we analyse an assemblage of 9,642 excavated stone artefacts from the rockshelter site of Walanjiwurru 1 in Marra Country in northern Australia, in light of the cosmological significance of regional stone sources to local Aboriginal groups. Each recovered stone artefact, and the quarries of their raw materials, is laden with meanings that help reveal how Marra Aboriginal people socially and cosmologically engaged with their landscape.

Sustained processing of fruit seeds is first visible in the archaeological record about 3500 years ago. Spatial and temporal variation in its intensity is evident since that time until it declines following European colonisation.

Many years previous, midden deposits to a depth of one metre were removed during roadworks so that the surface of the deposit in the rockshelter was level with the adjacent road. However, archaeological materials (eg stone artefacts) continued being found in the rockshelter. This suggested that, even though a considerable depth of deposit had been removed, all of the archaeological deposits had not been removed. And, even though the surface of the remaining deposits were disturbed, there was a possibility that undisturbed deposits remained at depth in the site. If so, that these deposits would contain evidence of Aboriginal occupation pre-dating 2,000 or 3,000 years ago (Attenbrow 1992). ...

Ayliffe:1988naracoorte,"Bone samples and associated speleothems from critical locations in limestone caves near Naracoorte, South Australia, were selected for U-series dating in order to test the reliability of U-aeries ages of bone material, and to make an informed age assessment of the bone deposit in terms of Quaternary climate. The age distribution of the speleothem samples reveals that speleothem growth ceased, or was considerably diminished, between 200 and 120 ka ago, a time corresponding to the penultimate glaciation (Oxygen-isotope Stage 6). This is consistent with observations from several other caves and suggests that conditions generally were unfavorable for speleothem formation during glacial periods. The U-aeries ages of fossil bones are inconsistent with those of associated speleothems, indicating secondary U addition to the bones. Discordancy between 230Th/234U and 231Pa/235U ages suggests that this secondary uptake of U was not a single event, but a more or less continuous process. However, the 234U/238U signatures of the bones are more consistent with a model of U assimilation caused by a succession of short events, than by a process of continuous diffusion. The absolute age control provided by the speleothems, combined with the minimum age limits for individual bones, suggest that the bone deposit was formed prior to the last interglacial period, most probably during Oxygen-isotope Stage 6.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Backwell:2014wonderkrater,"Here we provide a multiproxy record of climate change and human occupation at Wonderkrater, a spring and peat mound site situated in the interior of southern Africa. Recently extracted sediment cores yielded a number of Middle Stone Age (MSA) artefacts, prompting exploratory excavation of the sediments to understand better the geomorphology of the site, age of the sediments, cultural lithic sequence, vegetation and faunal remains, and to try to establish whether human use of the site was to some extent climatically driven. Excavations yielded late Pleistocene mammal fauna and flora, and three small MSA lithic assemblages with age estimates of 30 ka, >45 ka and 138.01 ± 7.7 ka. The upper layers comprise peat that preserves macrobotanical and faunal remains, implying local fen conditions in Acacia savanna woodland at 12 ka. Below the upper peat layers, a 1 m-thick layer of white sand yielded two MSA lithic assemblages in association with faunal remains dated to between 30.8 ± 0.7 ka and >45 ka. Clay underlying the sand has an OSL age of 63.1 ± 5.8 ka, and sandy peat below it has an Infrared Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) age of 70 ± 10 ka. Faunal remains in the lower sand levels, and dental stable carbon isotope analysis of herbivores, indicate a substantial grassland component in the landscape during late MIS 3 (>45 ka). Charcoal, phytolith and pollen data show a change from moderately warm and dry grassy savanna woodland in the lower sand levels, to cooler and wetter grassland with woody shrubs in the uppermost levels by 30 ka. The conditions that resulted in the deposition of the sand also attracted people to the site, but whether it served as an oasis in an arid landscape, or was occupied during wet phases, is unclear.

Building on earlier work by Cable in 1979 we excavated the site in three seasons between 2016 and 2018 and recovered important archaeological data on the later part of the Middle Stone Age [MSA] and the Later Stone Age [LSA]. New OSL dates of the sequence demonstrate that the site was used intensively during the final MSA and the Pleistocene LSA. We identified 12 geological units covering a sequence of nearly 2 m thickness. Excavations have not yet reached bedrock. Here we focus on the assemblage from layer 7 which marks the latest expression of the MSA at Umbeli Belli. The layer provided an OSL age of 29 ± 2 ka and was found to contain some of the most distinct formal tools of the MSA, the so-called hollow-based points. Taking aside two isolated finds from Kleinmonde and Border Cave, this tool type was elsewhere found exclusively within the terminal MSA occupations of Sibudu and Umhlatuzana. Notwithstanding the fact that hollow-based points are likely to represent one of the most reliable fossil directeurs of the MSA, neither the tools themselves nor the corresponding assemblages in which they are found have so far received adequate attention compared to other periods. Based on current results from Umbeli Belli we provide new techno-typological evidence about the final MSA in the eastern part of South Africa together with new radiometric dates. We observe first that hollow-based points are not the only defining feature of the final MSA and should be rather seen as embedded within a diagnostic technocomplex. We question existing typological differentiations of traditional tool types, such as unifacial and bifacial points, and provide alternative assessments based on the morphological and physical properties of retouched tools. Finally we discuss the final MSA period in and surrounding KwaZulu-Natal in the light of new dating results and address future perspectives.",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,

Balco:2005utah,"Cosmic‐ray‐produced 10Be and 26Al in riverborne quartz sediment are commonly used to estimate average catchment‐scale erosion rates. Likewise, the concentrations of these nuclides in ancient sediments, stored in a depositional basin, carry a record of past erosion rates in the sediment source area. This is important because such a record could be compared to records of climate change or tectonic events to elucidate relationships between climate, tectonics and erosion. If the sediments are shielded from the cosmic‐ray flux after deposition, for example in deep water, their nuclide concentrations need only be corrected for radioactive decay since deposition in order to determine past erosion rates. Where sediment is deposited subaerially and buried relatively slowly, on the other hand, the additional nuclide concentration that builds up during sediment accumulation and storage must be reconstructed and subtracted in order to recover the initial nuclide concentrations in the sediment and thence the past erosion rates.  ...

North-south variations in erosion rate, range elevation, and metrics of landscape relief and steepness are consistent with the hypotheses that i) their primary cause is northward-migrating crustal thickening; ii) erosion rates are strongly controlled by topographic relief and weakly, if at all, controlled by climate; and iii) the dependence of erosion on relief is nonlinear and obeys a threshold-relief relationship.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Ballard:1995thesis,"The relationship between environmental conditions and the decisions and actions of historical agents is the central issue of this thesis. In a brief review of the role that social and environmental factors have played in archaeological explanation, I describe the scope for a form of archaeological ethnography in which particular attention is paid to the contrast between the different worlds of meaning in and through which historical agents address their environments. In the context of a debate over the impact of sweet potato upon society and environment in the New Guinea Highlands, the history of wetland use emerges as a focus for competing positions on the nature of explanation for relationships between societies and their environments. My study addresses this debate through consideration of the recent history of Huli-speaking communities of the Tari region, in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Part B sets out an ethnographic model of the relationship between Huli people and their environment. External and Huli perceptions of landscape, society and agricultural production are presented in order to permit explanations for change that encompass both the intention of the Huli agents of the recent historical past, and the broader social environmental processes of which those historical individuals cannot have been aware. ...

Balme:1990darling,"Seventy two of the 88 radiocarbon determinations available for archaeological sites and the sediments associated with the Darling River, its anabranches and associated lakes between Wilcannia and the Murray River in western NSW, are on shell samples collected from middens. The geographic distribution of the dated sites reflects the past hydrology of the region and distribution of preservational sediments in the area as well as past human use of the region. The earliest evidence for human use of the lakes is from a series of middens at Lake Tandou which are dated to about 27,000 years BP but the lack of older sites may simply reflect the lack of exposure normally provided by active dune formation. All of the Pleistocene shell middens are associated with an ancestral Darling River course which was activated some time before 36,000 years ago and is now represented by anabranches of the present river channel. Holocene shell middens between Wilcannia and the Murray River are all associated with the present Darling River channel which formed sometime between 9,000 and 7,000 years ago. These dates when taken in conjunction with the radiocarbon dates on shell middens from the Willandra area show that there has been an almost continuous use of aquatic resources in the Murray-Darling Basin since about 36,000 years BP. When radiocarbon dates on charcoal from other archaeological sites in the area are added to this sequence the discontinuities in the shell date sequence are filled. This indicates that there has been a continuous human presence in the Murray-Darling Basin since this time.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Balme:1990tradition,"The economic life of the early colonisers of semi-arid western New South Wales is represented by  many small open sites mainly preserved within sand dunes. Preservation of organic materials in  this environment has been dependent upon rapid deposition of overlying sediments to protect  them from erosion and degradation. Once uncovered, fragile material such as freshwater crustacea  carapace and fish bone rapidly decays, shell fragments and disperses, while other materials such as  fish otoliths and clay hearthstones survive much longer. An understanding of this problem has  allowed analysis to proceed to the following results:  1. The 232 recorded archaeological sites containing faunal remains and associated with the water  channels and lakes of the lower Darling River region in western New South Wales span a period of  27,000 years BP to the present. However preservation of materials within this time span is uneven  both spatially and temporally. The distribution pattern of these archaeological sites in time and  space is largely a reflection of past geomorphological processes rather than past cultural  preference of campsite positions.  2. By noting the condition of the site materials it is possible to determine their contemporaneity  to some extent. Typically a well- preserved Pleistocene site in the lower Darling River region  consists of a single concentration of bivalve remains but species other than shell fish dominate  some of the other Pleistocene sites. Sites dominated by other species, however, resemble the shell  middens in that they characteristically consist of a single cluster of faunal remains. Species  other than the dominant species are rare or absent. This suggests a foraging strategy in which  collectors targeted a single species for each foraging expedition.   3. The large numbers of individual animals in some of the sites which represent such single  expeditions indicate that the gathering of aquatic species was not incidental to basic survival  strategies. In addition, the large numbers of fish present in such sites coupled with the size  distribution of the fish represented in the sites suggests the use of nets to capture the fish.  Thus the Darling River material represents the oldest evidence in the world for systematic  exploitation of aquatic resources. This and the associated fibre technology may well be a  tradition seated deep in Pleistocene Asia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Changes in hunting patterns and in hearth-making practices about 34000 years ago appear to accompany a change to drought resistant vegetation in the site surrounds. Occupation during the Last Glacial Maximum highlights variation in aridity trends in the broader environmental record. The most intensive use of the cave was during a wet period in the early to middle Holocene, when people appear to have received marine shell beads from the coast through social networks.

Banerjee:2002riverine,"We present the first quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages for palaeochannel sediments from the Riverine Plain in southeastern Australia. For young fluvial sediments, we agree with the notion that analysis of the leading edge of a dose distribution curve provides an objective method for determining the OSL age. For a modern flood deposit (less than 200 years old), the OSL ages estimated using the leading edge method (250 ± 50 years) and by using the lowest 5% of the measured dose in single aliquots (230 ± 50 years) agree within experimental errors. For older sediments, we suggest that the mean estimate of the dose distribution is likely to provide a reliable estimate of the OSL age. The luminescence ages suggest that the Coleambally and Kerarbury palaeochannel systems were active between 105 and 80 and 55 and 35 thousand years ago; the Yanco palaeochannel system could have been active as recently as 9000 years ago.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

For the younger dunes (<240 ka), the SAR-OSL ages agree with the expected ages within 1σ errors, whereas for the older dunes the SAR ages are consistent with independent ages within 2σ error limits.

Barbetti:1973thesis,"This thesis presents the results of the first detailed archaeomagnetic and radiocarbon study of ancient Aboriginal fireplaces in Australia. A furnace, designed and built during the present study, is described in detail, and a reappraisal is made of the method of calculating radiocarbon ages. A pilot study of some undated Aboriginal fireplaces demonstrated the suitability of their baked clay ovenstones for Thellier palaeointensity studies, and allowed estimates of their ages to be made by comparing the measured ancient field intensities with the known prehistoric fluctuation of the Earth‘s magnetic field. Measurements on oriented clay-sand ovenstones from a series of ovens exposed on the open plains revealed that the ovenstones had not been displaced since the time of last cooling, and provided a preliminary archaeo-secular variation curve for southeastern Australia. A comparison of these results with those from other parts of the world suggests that the non-dipole contribution to the field in southeastern Australia was small during the period 1500 yr to 500 yr B.P Measurements were also made on a series of fireplaces exposed by modern erosion of ancient sediments in the Lake Mungo lunette. The fireplaces recorded a geomagnetic excursion occurring between 31,000 yr and 25,000 yr B.P. It appears that there were two excursion loops, one characterized by a high geomagnetic moment (about 50 x 10^25 gauss.cm3), and a second loop at a time of low dipole moment (about 50 x 10^25 gauss.cm^3). During both these excursion loops, the geomagnetic field rotated more than 90° away from the axial dipole configuration. The evidence suggests that the geomagnetic field was dipolar during both excursion loops. The excursion at a time of low dipole moment may be an aborted reversal of the field, while the observed excursion with a large dipole moment is thought to be a rare and perhaps new type of dynamo behaviour. The similarity of virtual geomagnetic pole positions in both types of excursion to those observed in other excursions or polarity transitions during the last 15 million years suggests that some common mechanism is controlling or restraining the processes occurring in the Earth‘s core.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Extensive prehistoric relict mound-and-ditch horticultual field systems located on low, flat clayland areas adjacent to the swamps appear to have been constructed after 2500 yr BP, but before 19th century European contact, based on archaeological and ethnographic evidence. Facies changes in swamp basin infill stratigraphy indicate conformable deposition within tidal lagoonal mangrove environments until c. 3000 yr BP. Then shallowing water conditions resulted in a transition to brackish-freshwater facies, and a vegetation change to sedge-dominated swamps. The observed shift from mangrove to sedge-dominated communities occurred during a falling trend in local relative sea level which may have initiated mangrove dieback. Onset of allocthonous deposition of clayland-derived sediments, related to horticulture on swamp-marginal clayland, significantly post-dates the mangrove to sedge community change in the pollen record. Close temporal coincidence of radiocarbon dates for human occupation and sandy facies deposition at swamp edges implies significant anthropic disturbance on the clayland around 1200 yr BP, but evidence for a process-link remains equivocal.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Barham:2004bepotaim,"Traditional Torres Strait Islander culture, viewed at European contact, demonstrated levels of maritime resource exploitation, canoe technology and seafaring skills, inter-island trade, and use of horticulture/agriculture to a degree unparalleled elsewhere in Australia. How long this maritime-focused cultural complex has existed in the island archipelago connecting Australia with Papua New Guinea, the onset dates for island occupation in the Holocene, and the cultural impact of the late Holocene ‘connectedness‘induced by exchange across Torres Strait on adjacent mainlands remain central questions for archaeological enquiry. A retrospective overview of archaeological research and investigations in the Torres Strait region is presented, from early preliminary field investigations in the 1970s through to the emergence of divergent thematic investigations spanning historic and prehistoric periods, underway in the year 2000. Radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites confirm occupation of the islands since 2500 years ago. Moreover, the regional archaeological site chronology for Torres Strait suggests most islands with good water resources supported populations, albeit in some cases seasonally transient ones, after 1,500 BPP. Some aspects of the archaeological chronology, the nature of culture sites and their spatial distribution within islands accord well with recent oral histories, and some ethnographic observations. However, other aspects of the emerging chronology, and in particular similarities in the range and type of sites across the Strait, and patterns between islands, strongly suggest that other facets of archaeological data either do not fit, contradict, or are simply unrecorded in, the ethnohistorical sources. In particular, some ethnohistorically derived culture/language/trade groupings may have limited antiquity as seen in the archaeological record.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Along with other recent evidence (Allen et al. 1989, O‘Connor 1989, Morse 1988) this site represents clear evidence of a continuous marine sequence spanning the Holocene. The continued use of marine resources including mangrove species throughout the Holocene argues against a time lag in the occupation of coastal sites and questions the effects of marine transgression on human populations and marine resources. Major changes in the archaeological record at Nara Inlet 1 do not coincide with the major environmental changes documented for the Holocene period in this area and it is considered that social explanations for change may offer a more fruitful interpretation.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Barker:1995thesis,"This thesis examines prehistoric coastal use on the tropical east coast of Australia. Concepts of maritime hunter-gatherers are usually associated with complex, sedentary, politically hierarchical peoples of the northern hemisphere. On the tropical coast of Australia there is clear evidence for highly specialised coastal peoples who can clearly be termed maritime hunter-gatherers, despite lacking this degree of complexity. Explanations for coastal occupation in Australia focus largely on the late Holocene, the period to which the over-whelming number of coastal archaeological sites are dated. Models of coastal occupation explaining the late Holocene pattern of coastal use in Australia tend to give primacy to ‘external‘, single cause, ‘prime mover‘ explanations. These include inherent biological population increase, technological change, site preservation factors and environmental change. Sea-level changes after the last glacial period, culminating in present levels being attained at about 6,500 BP, are seen as especially important in regard to human use of coasts. A number of models propose that sea-level change had a dramatic negative effect on the coastal resource base, thus limiting and restricting coastal occupation until at least stabilisation, and in some cases well after. The archaeological evidence for the Whitsunday region indicates that people lived continuously in the region throughout the Holocene from at least 9,000 BP, utilising a continuous and largely unchanging marine resource base. ...

Barker:2006abbot,"Abbot Point on the central Queensland coast has long been recognised as an area of cultural heritage significance (Environmental Protection Agency 1999). The area has essentially been ignored in terms of research archaeology because of the lack of integrity of the cultural material, nearly all of which sits on deflated dune surfaces. Because of the problems associated with preservation of open sites in coastal tropical environments (see Bird 1992) most archaeological reconstructions in the region have been based on rockshelter deposits. However, the sheer volume and density of archaeological material found along the coast in this region indicate that open coastal sites such as Abbot Point and Upstart Bay to the north were probably intensively used with evidence of a much greater range of generalised hunter-gatherer activity in comparison to the more specialised rockshelter sites (Barker 2004; Bird 1992; Brayshaw 1990). Thus, given the evidence of intensive use of Abbot Point and its central location within a system of other clearly linked sites within the region (see below), it was felt that an attempt should be made to include this site within the wider framework of regional site patterning and use and that in this context an attempt should be made to establish its temporality.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Barr:2017welsby,"There are few continuous Australian palaeoclimate records that extend beyond the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), meaning that knowledge of regional climates before, during and after this period is limited. Understanding late-Pleistocene climates of the subtropics is important because of the fundamental role the region plays in the large-scale, global transfer of energy from low latitudes. Palaeoclimate studies of subtropical regions can help define the extent of warming/cooling during the large global climatic events which characterise the late-Pleistocene. Here we report the results from a multi-proxy analysis of a sediment record from Welsby Lagoon on North Stradbroke Island, in the eastern Australian subtropics, spanning the past ca. 25,000 years. Stable C and N isotope analysis and high resolution contiguous records of macrocharcoal deposition and sediment organic content are interpreted in conjunction with a previously published pollen record. Sediment organic content displayed a very strong correlation with total organic carbon (TOC) content as determined through elemental analysis and, given the peaty nature of the sediment, is interpreted as indicative of moisture balance. The proxies reflect wet subtropical climates in the lead up to the LGM which led to an expansion of the wetland. This was followed by a cool, dry and windy LGM (ca. 22.3--19.7'000 years before present; kyr BP), which was punctuated by a brief wet phase ca. 21.7--20.4 kyr BP. A salient feature of the deglacial period is a rapid increase in TOC around 15 kyr BP, coincident with the Antarctic Cold Reversal and Bølling-Allerød warm phase. Increased fire frequency is evident in the Holocene, which is characterised by otherwise stable climate and vegetation. This study supports the notion of variable climates during the LGM and finds an onset of deglacial warming in the Australian subtropics that predates the Holocene.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Barr:2019precipitation,"The La Niña and El Niño phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have major impacts on regional rainfall patterns around the globe, with substantial environmental, societal and economic implications. Long-term perspectives on ENSO behaviour, under changing background conditions, are essential to anticipating how ENSO phases may respond under future climate scenarios. Here, we derive a 7700-year, quantitative precipitation record using carbon isotope ratios from a single species of leaf preserved in lake sediments from subtropical eastern Australia. We find a generally wet (more La Niña-like) mid-Holocene that shifted towards drier and more variable climates after 3200 cal. yr BP, primarily driven by increasing frequency and strength of the El Niño phase. Climate model simulations implicate a progressive orbitally-driven weakening of the Pacific Walker Circulation as contributing to this change. At centennial scales, high rainfall characterised the Little Ice Age (~1450–1850 CE) in subtropical eastern Australia, contrasting with oceanic proxies that suggest El Niño-like conditions prevail during this period. Our data provide a new western Pacific perspective on Holocene ENSO variability and highlight the need to address ENSO reconstruction with a geographically diverse network of sites to characterise how both ENSO, and its impacts, vary in a changing climate.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

This work first highlights the importance of selecting two dosimeters in an archaeological or geological context. It also put in the foreground the time-consuming but gratifying approach of comparing large and small aliquots. Finally, we present feldspars with a barely detectable and measurable fading rate, whatever the protocol applied, suggesting that the solution to anomalous fading might be to find feldspar grains that do not fade.",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,

Barreto:2013minas,"To investigate denudation rates in the southern part of the Espinhaço Range (central-eastern Brazil) and to understand how this important resistant and residual relief has evolved in the past 1.38My, cosmogenic 10Be concentrations produced in situ were measured in alluvial sediments from the three main regional basins, whose substratum is composed primarily of quartzites. The long-term denudation rates (up to 1.38My) estimated from these measurements were compared with those that affect the western (São Francisco River) and eastern (Doce and Jequitinhonha Rivers) basins, which face the West San Francisco craton and the Atlantic, respectively. Denudation rates were measured in 27 samples collected in catchments of different sizes (6-970km2) and were compared with geomorphic parameters. The mean denudation rates determined in the northern part are low and similar to those determined in the southern part, despite slightly different geomorphic parameter values (catchment relief and mean slope). For the southern catchments, the values are 4.91±1.01mMy-1 and 3.65±1.26mMy-1 for the Doce and São Francisco River basins, respectively; for the northern catchments, they are 4.40±1.06mMy-1 and 3.96±0.91mMy-1 for the Jequitinhonha and São Francisco River basins, respectively. These low values of denudation rates suggest no direct correlation if plotted against geomorphic parameters such as the catchment area, maximum elevation, catchment relief, average relief and mean slope gradients. These values show that the regional landscape evolves slowly and is strongly controlled by resistant lithology, with similar erosional rates in the three studied basins.

In this region, which is predominantly composed of quartzites, the 10Be concentrations were measured in alluvial sediments from catchments in a preserved natural area of the Serra do Cipó National Park and on the Diamantina Plateau, which was subjected to diamond extraction from beginnings of XVIII century until the end of the XX. Two types of drainage were identified in the Diamantina Plateau area: (i) reworked drainage (alluvial sediments reworked by panning) and (ii) overloaded drainage (alluvial sediments originating from panning processes on saprolites located upstream). The mean denudation value for the natural drainages (∼4.4 m.My-1) is similar to that of the reworked drainages (∼4.3 m.My-1) However, the denudation rates obtained for eleven samples from three sites in overloaded basins range from ∼6.4 m My-1 to ∼22.8 m My-1 and are thus higher than those determined for the reworked and natural basins. These results show that despite the alluvium deposits have been intensely reworked by panning, the values of denudation rates were not changed, they are similar to denudation rates from the natural drainages.

Barry:2020tracking,"A compliance-based excavation on Parramatta River (western Sydney) found evidence of a brief visitation by Aboriginal people during the terminal Pleistocene (c.14 ka), from which an exotic raw material-medium-grained porphyroblastic andalusite-cordierite hornfels-was recovered. This raw material is rare in the region, only found in the Megalong Valley situated some 75 km west of the site in Parramatta, and separated from the site by the Blue Mountains-a 40 km wide, 1 km high dissected sandstone upland. Historical observations and geological evidence suggest that the Coxs River, which runs through the upland, formed the probable connection between the two locales. The formation of the site at c.14 ka, along with our broader understanding of the region, suggests that the upland was only explored after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and that the Great Dividing Range may have formed a significant barrier to early peopling of Sahul. Further, a delay between the end of the LGM and the exploration of the region implies populations were severely affected by the event and required considerable time to recover. The coincident timing of rapid sea-level rise from Meltwater Phase Pulse 1A and an increased supply of moisture associated with the Antarctic Climate Reversal at the time of many site initiations may have been factors in the upland and south west slopes visitation. Finally, the movement of the unusual hornfels artefact provides a coarse indication of the ranging territory for hunter-gatherers living in a temperate region (c. 8,000 km2) at this time. This is probably a lower estimate but begins to provide a quantitative value with which to begin to ratify the increasing divergence between archaeological and genomic studies in their definitions of mobility, sedentism and regional nomadism.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This study used alluvial archives from fluvial benches in two tributaries of the Upper Burdekin catchment together with the best available land use history and climate proxy records to provide insights into the timing of depositional events in this region over the past 500 years. This study suggests that mining and the increased runoff variability in the latter half of the nineteenth century are the likely sources of the original excess sediment that was used to build the bench features in these catchments. Grazing also contributed to increased bench sedimentation prior to 1900, however, the contribution of grazing was likely more significant in the second half of the 20th century, and continues to be a dominant land use contributor today.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Barton:1993balof,"Research into residues remaining on the edges of prehistoric tools after use and their survival in the archaeological record has developed in the last few years. Current techniques for removing, preparing, and identifying these residues, though not completely straightforward, can readily be learned and applied (Fullagar 1986, 1988; Fullagar et al. 1992; Loy 1983, 1987, 1990; Loy et al. 1992). The aim of these studies has been generally to determine the materials on which tools had been used and their relative frequency as an indicator of site function. Our study attempted not only to fulfill this aim, but to investigate a further problem, namely whether a change in the raw materials from which tools are made is an indication of a change in the range of materials on which they were used. (For an Australian example, see Fullagar et al. 1992.)  We examined samples of stone and shell tools from a series of stratified excavation units from the rockshelter Balof 2, New Ireland. Specifically, we tried to falsify two null hypotheses. These were that: (1) the same range of residues occurred on tools made of all raw materials and, (2) the same range of residues continued to be deposited through time. Here we show that at Balof 2 neither the replacement of other fine-grained materials by obsidian nor the commencement of use of shell tools indicate different uses.

Beaton:1977phd,"This thesis reports on archaeological fieldwork carried out between 1973 and 1975 in the southern part of the Great Dividing Range in Queensland, Australia. Fieldwork consisted of an areal .reconnaissance, sample excavations at three rocksheiter sites, and collection of surface artefacts at one open site. The findings include stone tools, bone tools, faunal and plant remains. Excavations and analyses have shown a marked intensification of Aboriginal use of the region beginning about 4000 to 5000 years ago. The increase in occupation is associated with the introduction of a new and distinctive stone tool technology. The rocksheiter excavations also showed that seeds of the cycad, Macrozanria moorei, were the most important food used at the sites, as evidenced by their remains in the shelter deposits. The cycads are known to be highly toxic and potentially carcinogenic to all mammals that have been given the plant material or extracts experimentally. The Aborigines of prehistoric Queensland eliminated the poison, probably by leaching the crushed seeds in water, although other methods may have been used. The natural history, human use and other features of cycads are discussed in light of modem issues in medical and anthropological research concerning these plants. It is proposed that the use of cycads in the Queensland uplands, and possibly elsewhere in Australia, had important implications for prehistoric social integration.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Beaumont:2019diversity,"The initial appearance of pottery on mainland New Guinea has been an elusive and sometimes controversial topic. A range of factors contribute to this conundrum including landscape transformation and disturbance where relevant archaeology may be undetectable, or misinterpreted, and a lack of sound evidence from various sites that could facilitate comparative analysis. Moreover, the preeminence of the Lapita pottery sequence and its clear dispersal model has set expectations and perceptions concerning the oldest known pottery on New Guinea, which sometimes has resulted in scanty finds being interpreted on a prioriconceptual grounds rather than according to substantive or direct local evidence.

Here, we compare previous calculations by linear interpolation of δ13C and a complex computer simulation of marine contribution to the diet of inhumations from the SAC archaeological site Watom Island, Papua New Guinea, with the ISOSOURCE mixing model and a revised database of regional dietary sources and their isotopic values, to estimate marine diet contributions and radiocarbon offsets for burials from the SAC site.

Beck:2019tasmania,"The impacts of fire and climate on freshwater ecosystems are not well understood, masking the potential impacts of anthropogenic climate change on these systems. A 9200 year Holocene record of sedimentary Carbon/Nitrogen, x-ray fluorescence, charcoal, pollen, and diatoms preserved within a freshwater lake in Tasmania was used to understand the influences of climate variability and fire on aquatic ecosystem response. Western Tasmania is a cool temperate environment where fire occurrence is driven by hydroclimate. High rainfall during the early to mid-Holocene drove an increase in rainforest and peat in the absence of fire, resulting in an oligotrophic and turbid aquatic environment. This also resulted in leaching of humic acid from the catchment, increasing acidity and dystrophy. The onset of a drier, more variable hydroclimate from the mid-to late Holocene drove lower lake levels and a shift to the dominant planktonic diatom species, Discostella stelligera, the result of the unusual bathymetry of Lake Vera where planktonic diatoms increase with lower lake levels. Further drying caused burning of the rainforest (at ca. 2.3 ka) and increased terrigenous deposition into the lake, leading to a productive, alkaline and disturbed diatom community. Repeated fire disturbance resulted in increased inorganic material deposition, the removal of nutrient rich peat, and an invasion of ferns and sclerophyll vegetation. These fire-driven catchment changes caused a shift in the diatom community to low productivity, oligotrophic and acidic assemblages, likely due to restricted light availability and nutrient uptake by increased deposition of terrigenous material. Therefore, the aquatic ecosystem is responding to climate-mediated changes in the terrestrial environment consistent with regional trends in nearby terrestrial-aquatic Holocene records.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Beck:2020mining,"Mining causes extensive damage to aquatic ecosystems via acidification, heavy metal pollution, sediment loading, and Ca decline. Yet little is known about the effects of mining on freshwater systems in the Southern Hemisphere. A case in point is the region of western Tasmania, Australia, an area extensively mined in the 19th century, resulting in severe environmental contamination. In order to assess the impacts of mining on aquatic ecosystems in this region, we present a multiproxy investigation of the lacustrine sediments from Owen Tarn, Tasmania. This study includes a combination of radiometric dating (14C and 210Pb), sediment geochemistry (XRF and ICP-MS), pollen, charcoal and diatoms. Generalised additive mixed models were used to test if changes in the aquatic ecosystem can be explained by other covariates. Results from this record found four key impact phases: (1) Pre-mining, (2) Early mining, (3) Intense mining, and (4) Post-mining. Before mining, low heavy metal concentrations, slow sedimentation, low fire activity, and high biomass indicate pre-impact conditions. The aquatic environment at this time was oligotrophic and dystrophic with sufficient light availability, typical of western Tasmanian lakes during the Holocene. Prosperous mining resulted in increased burning, a decrease in landscape biomass and an increase in sedimentation resulting in decreased light availability of the aquatic environment. Extensive mining at Mount Lyell in the 1930s resulted in peak heavy metal pollutants (Pb, Cu and Co) and a further increase in inorganic inputs resulted in a disturbed low light lake environment (dominated by Hantzschia amphioxys and Pinnularia divergentissima). Following the closure of the Mount Lyell Co. in 1994 CE, Ca declined to below pre-mining levels resulting in a new diatom assemblage and deformed diatom valves. Therefore, the Owen Tarn record demonstrates severe sediment pollution and continued impacts of mining long after mining has stopped at Mt. Lyell Mining Co.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Bell:1976thermoluminescence,"The Kuk Tea Research Station, established by the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries in 1969, is a 700 acre property (mostly swampland) about 15 km northeast of the township of Mount Hagen. The long and complex history of the Kuk swamp extends back into the late Pleistocene as recorded in layers of volcanic ash from up to a dozen different eruptions. This investigation is concerned mainly with the period from about 300 years ago when widespread use was made of the drained swampland in a system of sweet potato agriculture. A grid of wide, deep barets (ditches or drains cut for water control) subdivided by a close grid of small, shallow, flat-bottomed barets characterises the drainage of the swampland for cultivation of the sweet potato. Several house sites associated with this culture have been excavated and cooking stones from the fires and cooking pits of each house collected. Research into the possibility of dating these cooking stones by thermoluminescence (TL) was instigated after discussion with Professor J. Golson, Department of Prehistory, Research School of Pacific Studies, A.N.U. Initially the problem was to date and thus chronologically order eight houses unearthed in one block, A9g, of the close grid baret system (see fig. 1). All the houses were expected to be less than 300 years old, being younger than a volcanic ash layer dated by C-14 to around 300 years. The stones themselves were predominantly of the metavolcanic type and were, on average, approximately 5 to 10cm in diameter. In view of their relatively recent heating in the cooking fires and since TL dating measures time elapsed since last heating, the TL Pre-dose Technique developed by Fleming (1973) was adopted for this investigation.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bell:1978mungo,"This thesis is presented in two parts: Part I dealing with the theory of the thermoluminescence phenomenon and with the origins and effects of the natural radiation environment; and Part II dealing with three applications of the TL dating method to archaeological sites in Australia. The first chapter describes the theories and mechanisms thought responsible for the thermoluminescence phenomenon. The application of these theories to the principles of age determination using quartz is explained and a review of the thermoluminescent properties of quartz itself is given. Nothing further has been added to knowledge already extant in these areas as the purpose of this chapter is to lay the foundation for the work found later in the thesis. A full description of the setting up and calibration of the TL dating equipment, including the alpha counter, is given in the second chapter. The third chapter deals with the passage of alpha particles through matter. The theory of Howarth (1965) is modified in this chapter so as to quantify the absorbed dose from alpha particles passing through a 105 micron quartz grain and to describe the alpha dose reduction due to HF etching. The results are significantly different from the 'first order approximation' given by Fleming (1969, 19 70). In the fourth chapter the theoretical approach of Charlton (1970) for solving the problem of the energy dissipation of electrons passing through matter is discussed. This method is modified in this chapter to be applicable to a quartz grain irradiated by the natural radioactive series. The contribution from the internal conversion electrons is included in the dose attenuation factors. The assessment of the dose dilution resulting from etching the grains in HF is then given. The fifth chapter describes qualitatively the interaction of gamma radiation with matter. The concept of energy-absorption buildup factors is described and is used in the evaluation of the absorbed dose from an overlying clay layer. The dependence of the TL response on both the photon energy and the particle size is explained and a method for formulating a general solution of this problem is put forward. Specific solutions for the samples to be dated in Part II of this thesis are obtained. Chapter six presents detailed radiation data concerning the naturally occurring radioactive series. Tables giving the energy released during every transition of every radioisotope are given. These data are used to evaluate dose-rate conversion factors from ppm of the parent and from the alpha activity of the sample to mrad/yr. The information given in this chapter has been published. The seventh chapter commences Part II of the thesis and it is concerned with the TL dating of ancient Aboriginal fireplaces from Lake Mungo in western New South Wales. The inclusion technique of TL dating is used but particular attention is paid to the assessment of the alpha particle contribution to the dose-rate because of the irregularity of the etching of quartz grains in HF acid. Other complicating factors which are also considered in detail are the saturation of the electron traps, the internal radioactivity of the quartz grains, and the gamma dose from an overlying stratigraphic layer of much higher radioactive content than the fireplaces themselves. The ages of the Mungo fireplaces range from 31,400 to 36,400 years which confirms the antiquity of the site as suggested previously by radiocarbon age determinations on charcoal from the fireplaces. The radiocarbon ages are given in the eighth chapter and a small systematic discrepancy of between 10 and 15% appears to exist between them and the TL ages, with the TL ages being the older in each case. A full description of possible sources of error in the radiocarbon method is presented and one of these, the variations in the Earth's geomagnetic field, is put forward as a possible reason for the TL/C-14 age differences. The ninth chapter describes a further application of the inclusion technique, as modified in the seventh chapter, to Aboriginal fireplaces from Lake Jindabyne in New South Wales. The ages of these fireplaces lie between 2000 and 3000 years. In the tenth chapter the TL dating of cooking stones from New Guinea is described. Large uncertainties in the ages for these stones were encountered and an impurity analysis of the samples suggests that this is due to the high level of impurity diffusion into the quartz grains.

Bellin:2014betic,"The tectonic control on landscape morphology and long-term denudation is largely documented for settings with high uplift rates. Relatively little is known about the rates of geomorphic response in areas of low tectonic uplift. Here, we evaluate spatial variations in denudation of the Spanish Betic Cordillera based on cosmogenic 10Be-derived denudation rates. Denudation rates are compared to published data on rock uplift and exhumation of the Betic Cordillera to evaluate steady-state topography. The spatial patterns of catchment-wide denudation rates ( ) are then analysed together with topographic metrics of hillslope and channel morphology. Catchments draining the Betic ranges have relatively low denudation rates ( ), but also show large variation as they range from 14 to 246 mm kyr−1. Catchment-wide denudation is linearly proportional to the mean hillslope gradient and local relief. Despite large spatial variation in denudation, the magnitude and spatial pattern of denudation rates are generally consistent with longer-term local uplift rates derived from elevated marine deposits, fission-track measurements and vertical fault slip rates. This might be indicative of a steady-state topography where rock uplift is balanced by denudation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bellingham:2020ohau,"Understanding how active mountain landscapes contribute to carbon dioxide cycling and influences on long-term climate stability requires measurement of weathering fluxes from these landscapes. The few measured chemical weathering rates in the Southern Alps are an order of magnitude greater than in the rest of the world. Rapid tectonic uplift coupled with extreme orographic precipitation is driving exceptionally fast chemical and physical denudation. These rates suggest that weathering in landscapes such as the Southern Alps could play a significant role in carbon dioxide cycling. However, the relative importance of climate and tectonics driving these fast rates remains poorly understood. ... [_truncated_]",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2023-01-11 09:28:20.099 +0100
Belmont:2007clearwater,"We use the 10Be concentration in alluvial sand and gravel to document hillslope exposure history and trace the reduction in grain size of river alluvium in the Clearwater River basin, western Washington State. Clearwater tributary basins Wilson Creek (WC, 6 km2) and East Fork Miller Creek (EFMC, 12 km2) were each sampled in headwater and downstream sites for 10Be in alluvial sand (0.25–0.50 mm) and gravel (22.6–90 mm). Grain size distributions were determined at each sampling site as well as at several locations along the main stem of the Clearwater River. Channel and watershed geomorphology were quantified using long profile modeling and related morphometric analyses. We found that the 10Be concentrations differ significantly between the two grain size fractions at all four sampling locations. At both headwater sites the gravel exhibits 25\% lower 10Be concentrations compared to the sand. Similarly, the downstream site of Lower WC exhibits 55\% lower 10Be concentration in the gravel compared to the sand. In contrast, the gravel from the downstream site on Lower EFMC exhibited 22\% higher 10Be concentration in the gravel compared to the sand. The disparity in 10Be concentration at the WC sites is best explained by shielding of the coarser grain size fraction and its delivery to the channel by deep-seated landslide processes. More intense landsliding in the downstream WC site is consistent with the increased disparity of 10Be between the sand and gravel fractions at that site. The inverse relationship between the sand and gravel 10Be concentrations at the headwater EFMC site is best explained by a sediment provenance mechanism where the hillslope weathering rate exceeds the down-slope transport rate for this particular basin. The inverse grain size dependency (gravel > sand) observed in the downstream EFMC site requires a more complex interplay between hillslope and channel processes including cobble weathering and grain size reduction during fluvial transport, resulting in a dilution of the 10Be signal in the sand fraction downstream. These results underscore the importance of geomorphic consideration and the grain size sampled in the correct interpretation of basin-average erosion rates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

On Boullanger Island there was no significant difference between trapping success rate in the different habitats. However, on Whitlock Island, significantly greater trapping success rates were recorded in the dunal scrubland dominated by Nitraria billardierei and foredune heath than in succulent heath.

Bender:2018yukon,"Quantification of river incision via process rate laws represents a key goal of geomorphic research, but such models often fail to reproduce traits of natural rivers responding to base- level lowering. The Fortymile River flows from eastern Alaska in the United States to the Yukon River in Canada across a tectonically quiescent region with near-uniform precipitation and bedrock erosivity. We exploit these stable boundary conditions to quantify bedrock inci- sion evident in a gravel-capped strath terrace that flanks the lower ~175 km of the river and grades to the minimally incised headwaters. The terrace gravel yields a cosmogenic isochron burial age of 2.44 ± 0.24 Ma, consistent with abandonment triggered by late Pliocene–early Pleistocene Yukon River headwater capture. The deeply incised reach forms a linear knick- zone where basin relief nearly doubles and inferred bedrock incision rates (~19–110 m/m.y.) averaged since ca. 2.44 Ma increase downstream toward the Fortymile–Yukon River conflu- ence. Basin-scale 10Be-based erosion rates of tributaries to the Fortymile River trunk nearly double from the headwaters (~9 mm/k.y.) to the knickzone (average ~16 mm/k.y.), revealing the pace of ongoing landscape response to knickzone incision over 104 yr. Our observations calibrate a stream- ower model (erosion coefficient K ~ 1.1 × 10–6 m0.2) that closely reproduces the knickzone profile and thus implies long-term (104–106 yr) efficacy of a simple stream- power bedrock incision law.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Berry:2017thesis,"The Australian continent was reached around 50,000 years ago with its colonising populations rapidly expanding into all ecological regions. Colonization is believed to have been facilitated by well-structured communication strategies; mirrored in various forms of symbolic behaviour. Rock art is symbolic behaviour that reflects the in situ response of Indigenous populations to extreme environmental, climatic, and social change. Murujuga, located in the Northwest coast of Australia, is an ideal setting to analyse this rock art production. The durable geology, low erosion rates, and increasing archaeological contextualization from the surrounding Pilbara and Carnarvon bioregions allows for the contextualising of deep time rock art with archaeological correlates. This contextualisation provides the opportunity to investigate changing social dynamics of groups; and the impetus for variations in these throughout time. This research presents findings from a stylistic, spatial, and archaeological analysis of symbolic behaviour found in rock art on Murujuga (the Dampier Archipelago), focusing on the Pleistocene to the early Holocene. The main motivation is to understand how early cultural lifeways are mirrored in the associated early rock art phases on Murujuga; and to investigate the impetus for shifting social geographies during periods of extreme environmental and social pressure. Archaeological material excavated from three open sites on Rosemary Island is presented to contextualize the rock art corpus on an outer island of the Archipelago. ...

Bickford:2008wetland,"Microfossil, sediment and documentary records provide a history of European land use and its impact on the vegetation of the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia. Two sedimentary cores were analysed for their fossil pollen and charcoal composition. Chronologies were established using a combination of 210Pb, 14C and microfossil markers. Primary and secondary evidence for the spatial expansion of land uses in the region were compiled providing local-, bioregional- and regional-scaled European settlement histories. The settlement and land-use histories of the major vegetation types in the region were different and were closely determined by the nature of the vegetation itself. The sedimentary and microfossil records indicate that wetland and terrestrial vegetation have undergone sequential changes of composition. There is evidence of a decline in fire-sensitive understorey species and the decline is likely due to intensive firing and grazing of scleropyllous woodlands and forests early in European settlement. Early-settlement native forestry practices were intensive, however they did not alter overstorey tree composition. Mid-twentieth-century wholesale vegetation clearance is clearly marked in the pollen record by a decline in Eucalyptus and increase in herbaceous species. Wetland vegetation was highly impacted by European land practices through changes to sediment inputs and hydrological conditions that began prior to catchment clearance, during the phase of intensive firing and grazing. Through the integration of multiscaled, ecosystem-specific historical settlement histories and palaeoecological analysis, correlations between past land uses and biotic responses can be confidently demonstrated.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Bierman:2001background,"Understanding the tempo of sediment generation and transport is fundamental to understanding Earth as a system. For land managers, knowing rates of landscape change is important as they consider human impact on landscapes in a long-term context. Numerous means have been employed to estimate basin-scale erosion rates (Saunders and Young, 1983); many of these methods, such as calculations based on river sediment and solute transport rates, are influenced by human impacts or are useful only over short (10 to 100 y) time scales (Trimble, 1977). Other techniques involve reconstruction of initial topography or definition of sediment volumes and source areas; however, these techniques are feasible only in particular environments and geologic settings, many of which are uncommon (Bishop, 1985). Sediment transport rates can also be estimated using tracers (e.g., Lekach and Schick, 1995) and sediment traps.

Using isotopic analysis of both headwater and downstream samples, we determined that the semi‐arid, Rio Puerco Basin is eroding, on average, about 100 m Ma−1. This rapid rate of erosion is consistent with estimates made using other techniques and is likely to result from a combination of easily eroded lithologies, sparse vegetation, and monsoon‐dominated rainfall. Data from 331 stream water samples collected by the US Geological Survey between 1960 and 1995 are consistent with basin‐wide, average chemical denudation rates of only about 1·4 m Ma−1; thus, the erosion rates we calculate may be considered rates of sediment generation because physical weathering accounts for almost 99 per cent of mass loss. ...

Bierman:2007namibian,"Namibia, home to the dramatic Great Escarpment and one of the driest coastal plain deserts in the world is eroding slowly and uniformly at an average rate of ~8 m/My. To estimate this overall erosion rate, we col- lected water-transported sand from small ephemeral stream and river beds draining the coastal plain, the Great Escarpment, and the uplands as well as from the drainage networks of two major rivers, the Swakop and Omaruru, which have their headwaters on the uplands, cut across the escarpment zone, and traverse the coastal plain. We sampled sedi- ment from a variety of basin sizes (1 – 29,000 km2). We infer rates of landscape change from a series of 38 high preci- sion (1 sigma, 1.3–3.2\%; mean = 1.7±0.5\%) measurements of 10-Be made in quartz extracted from samples of river-borne sand (250 – 850 um grain size). All samples contain significant concentrations of 10-Be (0.54 – 1.75 million atoms/g quartz) which when considered as steady state erosion rates, results in a range from 4.1 to 12.2 m/My and an average of 8.3±1.9 m/My for the dataset as a whole. Considering the small basins by province, the upland is eroding at 4.9±0.8 m/My (n=3), the lowland at 7.8±1 m/My (n=1), and the escarpment zone at 8.2±2.3 m/My (n=11). The furthest downstream samples on the Swakop (29,000 km2) and Omaruru Rivers (8000 km2) give model erosion rates of 8.8±1.0 and 8.6±1.1 m/My respectively, rates which match well area-weighted averages of tributary streams (8.9±1.6 (n= 6) and 8.3±1.3 m/My (n=4), respectively). There is no downstream pattern in the 10- Be concentration along either main stem river nor is there any relation- ship between erosion rate and basin area in the dataset as a whole. What does all this mean? First, we find that basin-scale rates of ero- sion are 2X higher than those on exposed rock surfaces (as reported in Bierman and Caffee, 2001) suggesting that the presence of even a thin veneer of regolith speeds rock weathering. Second, rates of erosion estimated in fluvial sediment using 10-Be are remarkably homoge- neous, varying < 3X over large areas. Third, slow rates of erosion de- termined cosmogenically match well those modeled from thermochronologic data suggesting steady, slow erosion over time and fourth, the new cosmogenic data provide no evidence for significant escarpment retreat over time; rather, they suggest that the escarpment, and all other mega-geomorphic features of the Namibian landscape must be long-lived, stable landforms.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Bierman:2014view,"Southernmost Africa, with extensive upland geomorphic surfaces, deep canyons, and numerous faults, has long interested geoscientists. A paucity of dates and low rates of background seismicity make it challenging to quantify the pace of landscape change and determine the likelihood and timing of fault movement that could raise and lower parts of the landscape and create associated geohazards. To infer regional rates of denudation, we measured 10Be in river sediment samples and found that south-central South Africa is eroding ~5 m m.y.−1, a slow erosion rate consistent with those measured in other non-tectonically active areas, including much of southern Africa. To estimate the rate at which extensive, fossil, upland, silcrete-mantled pediment surfaces erode, we measured 10Be and 26Al in exposed quartzite samples. Undeformed upland surfaces are little changed since the Pliocene; some have minimum exposure ages exceeding 2.5 m.y.

Binnie:2006rapidly,"Cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in alluvial sediments have been widely used to estimate basin-wide denudation rates. This technique requires that sediments be well mixed so as to avoid biasing results towards particular source locations within the basin. However, few studies have tested for well-mixed sediment with cosmogenic nuclide data. We examine sediment mixing with measurements of in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be in alluvium from small, high-relief catchments in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, USA. The mixing at the reach scale was tested with three samples of channel sediment taken at 5 m intervals. Adequate mixing is indicated with almost identical 10Be concentrations for two samples while the third falls just outside one standard error. The mixing at channel confluences was tested at three sites where samples were obtained downstream of the tributary junction and from each of the tributaries upstream of the join. If the sediments are well-mixed, radionuclide concentrations for the downstream samples will reflect concentrations of the tributaries weighted by the rates of sediment production. The results show that sediment is insufficiently mixed at one junction, and indeterminate at another (that is, cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in the tributaries are too similar to determine source). At a third site, results suggest sufficient sediment mixing may be possible some distance downstream of the junction. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the assumption of well-mixed sediments may be invalid in small drainages subject to episodic sediment delivery. The alluvial samples should be collected well downstream of tributary junctions and tests for sediment mixing should be performed.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Binnie:2007developing,"Studies across a broad range of drainage basins have established a positive correlation between mean slope gradient and denudation rates. It has been suggested, however, that this relationship breaks down for catchments where slopes are at their threshold angle of stability because, in such cases, denudation is controlled by the rate of tectonic uplift through the rate of channel incision and frequency of slope failure. This mechanism is evaluated for the San Bernardino Mountains, California, a nascent range that incorporates both threshold hillslopes and remnants of pre-uplift topography. Concentrations of in situ–produced cosmogenic 10Be in alluvial sediments are used to quantify catchment-wide denudation rates and show a broadly linear relationship with mean slope gradient up to ∼30°: above this value denudation rates vary substantially for similar mean slope gradients. We propose that this decoupling in the slope gradient–denudation rate relationship marks the emergence of threshold topography and coincides with the transition from transport-limited to detachment-limited denudation. The survival in the San Bernardino Mountains of surfaces formed prior to uplift provides information on the topographic evolution of the range, in particular the transition from slope-gradient–dependent rates of denudation to a regime where denudation rates are controlled by rates of tectonic uplift. This type of transition may represent a general model for the denudational response to orogenic uplift and topographic evolution during the early stages of mountain building.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Binnie:2008bernardino,"Basin-averaged cosmogenic 10Be concentrations, apatite (U–Th)/He thermochronometry and incision into a dated palaeosurface constrain spatial and temporal variations in the rates of denudation experienced during the early-stages of orogenesis in the San Bernardino Mountains, California. Cosmogenic 10Be analysis measures denudation over intermediate (∼ 102–104 years) time scales and records rates which decrease from a maximum of 2700 ± 500 mm ka− 1 in the south to a minimum of 52 ± 5 mm ka− 1 in northern catchments. Corresponding rates from (U–Th)/He and incision into a dated palaeosurface measure long-term (∼ 106 years) denudation rates which decrease from between 1200 ± 400 mm ka− 1 in the south to a minimum of 30 ± 20 mm ka− 1 in the north. The temporal consistency observed in the broad-scale patterns of denudation rates probably results from the persistent imprint of the initial crustal architecture and drainage network. These have maintained an influence on slope distributions, and are thus fundamental factors controlling the gross patterns of denudation throughout the early stages of orogenesis. Where variations between the denudation rates measured over different time scales are apparent the intermediate-term rates are found to be consistently greater than the long-term, with the increase being more pronounced around the fault bounded peripheries of crustal blocks relative to quiescent block interiors. This provides empirical support for a model of mountain building whereby topographic development is dictated by the headward retreat of drainage systems that propagate away from zones of displacement. Our findings indicate that recent localised increases in denudation rates in young fault block orogens may be explained by a progressive denudational response to prior tectonic uplift, rather than a consequence of climatic change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Bird:1999abox,"We present results that validate a new wet oxidation, stepped-combustion procedure for dating 'old' charcoal samples. An acid-base-wet oxidation (ABOX) pretreatment procedure has been developed that is used in place of the conventional acid-base-acid (ABA) pretreatment. Combustions and graphitizations are performed in a vacuum line that is insulated from the atmosphere by a second backing vacuum to eliminate the risk of atmospheric leakage into the line at any stage of the procedure. Combustions are performed at 3 temperatures (330 °, 630 ° and 850 °) with a graphite target produced from the CO2 evolved during each combustion step. In this way, the removal of any contamination can be monitored, and a high degree of confidence can be placed on the final age. The pretreatment, combustion, graphitization, and measurement blank for the procedure, based on the analysis of a 'radiocarbon-dead' graphite, is 0.5 ± 0.5 µg C (1sigma, n=14), equivalent to 0.04 ± 0.02 pMC or an 'age' of approximately 60 ka for a 1 mg graphite target. Analyses of a 'radiocarbon-dead' natural charcoal after ABOX pretreatment and stepped combustion suggest that the total blank (including contamination not removed by pretreatment) may be higher than for graphite, ranging up to 0.10 ± 0.02 pMC. Additional experiments confirm good agreement with accepted values for the international low-14C 'New Kauri' standard (0.16-0.25 pMC). They also confirm excellent reproducibility, with 3 separate dates on different aliquots of a charcoal sample from Ngarrabullgan Cave (Queensland, Australia) ranging from 35.2 to 35.5 ka 14C BP. It is also demonstrated that the ABOX pretreatment, in conjunction with the new vacuum line described here, is able to remove contamination not removed by the conventional ABA pretreatment, suggesting that the technique can be used to produce reliable 14C dates on charcoal up to at least 50 ka.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bird:2002arnhem,"This study presents the results of an extensive radiocarbon dating program at the Nauwalabila I site in northern Australia. The results show that the radiocarbon chronology at Nauwalabila is reliable to ∼130cm depth, but below this depth coarse charcoal has been variably altered during a period in the early Holocene when an ephemeral groundwater table reached close to the ground surface of the time. Below ∼150cm none of the radiocarbon ages can be considered to indicate reliably the age of deposition of the sediments. Luminescence dates near the surface and at 110cm are concordant with the radiocarbon chronology in the upper part of the sequence, and hence the aberrant radiocarbon results below ∼150cm do not constitute a reason to doubt the accuracy of the luminescence chronology deeper in the stratigraphy. A conservative estimate of the age of the sequence, based on extrapolation of results from that portion of the sequence where the radiocarbon chronology is considered to be reliable, is consistent with the chronology proposed previously from luminescence dating. Both chronologies therefore suggest occupation of the site before 50,000 years. Based on sediment characteristics and the distribution of quartz, chert, quartzite and quartz crystal artefacts, there is no evidence that there has been significant vertical displacement of artefacts relative to the surrounding sand matrix. Both chemical alteration and physical translocation of charcoal contributed to the aberrant ages at depth in the deposit. The results point to the need for careful assessment of the suitability of charcoal for radiocarbon dating prior to analysis and to the dangers of relying on a small number of radiocarbon dates in the development robust site chronologies. Strategies for screening samples for suitability include (i) microscopic examination, (ii) not analysing samples unless they survive the full ABOX pretreatment, (iii) not analysing samples unless the material is significantly larger than the sediment matrix, (iv) using CHN analysis on both untreated and pretreated material to check for organic contamination and (v) using stepped combustion to check for concordancy in the ages of carbon released at successively higher temperatures.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bird:2003radiocarbon,"A technique for determining the radiocarbon age of both organic-carbon and carbonate-carbon in the eggshell of the large flightless birds Genyornis newtoni (now extinct) and Dromaius novaehollandiae (extant emu) is presented here. Stepped combustion (for organic-carbon) and stepped acidification (for carbonate-carbon) were used to obtain multiple age determinations for each sample, from which an assessment of the reliability of the ages is possible. Analysis of a Genyornis newtoni eggshell fragment known to have an age considerably beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating has indicated that the backgrounds obtainable using this approach are 0.1220.033pMC for the organic-carbon fraction and 0.0700.025pMC for the carbonate-carbon fraction. These backgrounds suggest that finite ages up to 50,000–55,000BP are readily achievable on eggshell using stepped combustion/acidification. Analysis of a single fragment of Genyornis eggshell from Williams Point, central South Australia, suggests that significant contamination of the organic-carbon fraction of the eggshell is possible, while ages for the carbonate fraction appear more reliable and indicate that the eggshell has an age of at least 49,0002000BP. A total of six analyses of single Genyornis newtoni and Dromaius novaehollandiae eggshell fragments from the Wood Point deposit in southern South Australia suggest ages for the samples of 41,000800 and 37,900700BP, respectively, while an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) sample from a location very close to the Genyornis sample has an age of 555ka (1σ). The OSL and calibrated radiocarbon ages for the Genyornis sample and the sand matrix overlap at two standard deviations, suggesting the most likely age for the eggshell and the sand matrix is ∼45 cal ka BP or earlier.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Our methodology is based on controlling core accumulation rates using a gamma autoregressive semiparametric model with an arbitrary number of subdivisions along the sediment. Using prior knowledge about accumulation rates is crucial and informative priors are routinely used. Since many sediment cores are currently analyzed, using different data sets and prior distributions, a robust (adaptive) MCMC is very useful. We use the t-walk (Christen and Fox, 2010), a self adjusting, robust MCMC sampling algorithm, that works acceptably well in many situations.

Here, we present the results of a palynological investigation from Lake Baraba, located in eastern Australia, which extends beyond 43 ka. Bands of oxidised sediment prior to the LGM suggest lake level fluctuations, however, lacustrine clays continued to be deposited throughout the LGM and into the early Holocene when the deposition of peat was initiated. The vegetation, a Casuarina woodland/shrubland with a mixed understorey, remained relatively stable from 443 kyr to the early Holocene, suggesting that this sclerophyllous vegetation was resilient to changes in climate. The vegetation of the LGM at Lake Baraba does not conform to previous descriptions of a treeless south-eastern Australia, and it is possible that it was a refugium for woodland. Myrtaceae expanded at the expense of Casuarinaceae from the early Holocene, with charcoal analyses suggesting that fire was an unlikely explanation.

Black:2006nexus,"This study presents a reconstruction of the fire activity of the last ~14,200 cal. years BP (before AD 1950) from Gooches Crater Right, located on the Newnes Plateau, approximately 150 km to the west of Sydney (33 degrees 27'S, 150 degrees 16'E) within the Blue Mountains National Park. Charcoal analysis and palynology were undertaken with the aim of untangling any inter-relationship between climate, humans and fire. A chronology of the site was provided by radiocarbon dating. The dominant control on fire in this environment during the Holocene appears to be climate. Periods of climate change, identified in previous studies, are associated with higher levels of fire activity. Fire was less ubiquitous between ~9,000 and 6,000 years BP, a period normally described as having a higher effective moisture in south-eastern Australia. The mid-Holocene fluctuations in charcoal may reflect anthropogenic fire, climate forcing or alternatively human responses to any climate change.

Black:2006thesis,"It is widely believed that Australian Aboriginals utilised fire to manage various landscapes however to what extent this impacted on Australia s ecosystems remains uncertain. The late Pleistocene/Holocene fire history from three sites within the Sydney Basin, Gooches Swamp, Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, were compared with archaeological and palaeoclimatic data using a novel method of quantifying macroscopic charcoal, which is presented in this study. The palynology and other palaeoecological proxies were also investigated at the three sites. The Gooches Swamp fire record appeared to be most influenced by climate and there was an abrupt increase in fire activity from the mid-Holocene perhaps associated with the onset of modern El Niño dominated conditions. The Kings Waterhole site also displayed an abrupt increase in charcoal at this time however there was a marked decrease in charcoal from ~3 ka. Lake Baraba similarly had displayed low levels of charcoal in the late Holocene. At both Kings Waterhole and Lake Baraba archaeological evidence suggests intensified human activity in the late Holocene during this period of lower and less variable charcoal. It is hence likely that at these sites Aboriginal people controlled fire activity in the late Holocene perhaps in response to the increased risk of large intense fires under an ENSO-dominated climate. The fire history of the Sydney Basin varies temporally and spatially and therefore it is not possible to make generalisations about pre-historic fire regimes. It is also not possible to use ideas about Aboriginal fire regimes or pre-historic activity as a management objective. The study demonstrates that increased fire activity is related to climatic variation and this is likely to be of significance under various enhanced Greenhouse scenarios. There were no major changes in the composition of the flora at all sites throughout late Pleistocene/Holocene although there were some changes in the relative abundance of different taxa. It is suggested that the Sydney Sandstone flora, which surrounds the sites, is relatively resistant to environmental changes. Casuarinaceae was present at Lake Baraba during the Last Glacial Maximum and therefore the site may have acted as a potential refugium for more mesic communities. There was a notable decline in Casuarinaceae during the Holocene at Lake Baraba and Kings Waterhole, a trend that has been found at a number of sites from southeastern Australia.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Bonhomme:1985magnetic,"The analysis and interpretation of surface sites continue to present problems
 for most Australian archaeologists. Survey work especially in semi-arid environments has been limited by problems associated with the erosional history of the site and often a lack of visibility of artefact materials. The visibility of surface materials and the identification of site boundaries is dependent upon exposure, which is often gradual or patchy and therefore the designation of a site boundary during survey is often arbitrary. Erosion processes result in mixing of surface and sub-surface materials and a chrorlology for these materials is often hard to establish. The critical problems facing the interpretation of many open sites cannot satisfactorily be solved by current survey and analytical methods. At present exploratory open site excavation is considered time -consuming, expensive and destructive. In the political climate prevailing today in Australian archaeology, additional problems face the researcher who wishes to open up large areas of a site. Interested Aboriginal groups are tentative about giving permission for large-scale exploratory excavation which may effectively destroy a site. Therefore, in the application of heritage legislation. government agencies are concerned to find ways in which current archaeological research may be undertaken but at the same time ensuring that sample of either a site or a type of site is preserved for future changing research or heritage requirements. Clearly, methods which are non-destructive in their application but which effectively delimit potential excavation areas are required in these circumstances. This paper discusses the use of a non-destructive geophysical method for locating buried features at an open site at Bunda Lake, in western New South Wales.

This is contrasted with Hiscock & Hall‘s (1988a; 1988b) hypothesis that there was late Holocene technological change in the Moreron Region. Their hypothesis reveals technological change on fine-grained siliceous raw materials at three rockshelters  in this region. The temporal boundaries of the technological change so far noted remain somewhat unclear. The development of a relative dating system for lithic surface scatters in the Moreton Region is discussed in relation to the results. A larger sample of assemblages and radiocarbon dates is needed before a successful relative dating system can operate in this region.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bookhagen:2012andes,"The tectonic and climatic boundary conditions of the broken foreland and the orogen interior of the southern Central Andes of northwestern Argentina cause strong contrasts in elevation, rainfall, and surface-process regimes. The climatic gradient in this region ranges from the wet, windward eastern flanks (~ 2 m/yr rainfall) to progressively drier western basins and ranges (~ 0.1 m/yr) bordering the arid Altiplano-Puna Plateau. In this study, we analyze the impact of spatiotemporal climatic gradients on surface erosion: First, we present 41 new catchment-mean erosion rates derived from cosmogenic nuclide inventories to document spatial erosion patterns. Second, we re-evaluate paleoclimatic records from the Calchaquíes basin (66°W, 26°S), a large intermontane basin bordered by high (> 4.5 km) mountain ranges, to demonstrate temporal variations in erosion rates associated with changing climatic boundary conditions during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. ...

Boot:2002didthul,"The hinterland of the NSW South Coast has long been considered a cultural heritage backwater in comparison to the adjacent coastal strip. While the coast has been the focus of intensive archaeological research for several decades, the forested hills, mountains and plateaux between the coastline and the tablelands have only been investigated by a small number of archaeologists. Paradoxically, many coastal researchers developed models of hinterland Aboriginal occupation without conducting any field research there. Before commencement of the research program described here, only two excavations had been completed in the South Coast hinterland, compared to over 20 on the adjacent coast. The research described in this thesis was developed to provide more balance between coastal and hinterland archaeological knowledge. The research program includes reviews of previous work, existing site distribution data and ethnohistoric records. An extensive fieldwork program of survey, excavation and artefact collection was also completed. The materials and data obtained in the field were subjected to a wide range of laboratory and computer analyses. An extensive radiocarbon dating program was also undertaken. The results discussed in the first nine chapters have been interpreted and synthesised in the final chapter to provide a preliminary prehistory of the South Coast hinterland. Some of the major results have led to a revision of many previously represented hypotheses, but others have withstood rigorous testing. The research has demonstrated that hinterland Aboriginal occupation was extensive and wide ranging, was probably not seasonal and has a late Pleistocene antiquity. The results also indicate that the intensity of hinterland occupation fluctuated geographically and temporarily, possibly in relation to environmental change, local resource abundance, spiritual associations and as a result of Aboriginal economic and subsistence strategies. The work has allowed the identification of preferred resource exploitation and inhabitation zones within the hinterland, which range from the Pleistocene preference for well watered and protected locations to a Holocene focus on highly biodiverse hinterland valley woodlands. The strategies used to exploit such environments have also been discussed. The research has shown that, although exchange networks were largely restricted to within the hinterland, the Aboriginal occupants had extensive social and ritual networks which linked them with coastal areas to the north, south and east and with the tablelands to the west. Overall the research presented here indicates that Aboriginal people have successfully inhabited and exploited a diverse range of hinterland environments over many millennia. The descendents of those original inhabitants still maintain strong connections with the hinterland‘s unique cultural heritage.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The estuary currently receives most of its sediment during large episodic floods that are typically associated with cyclones. Mean annual sediment budgets for such systems are difficult to estimate due to the sporadic nature of flood discharge events, which are highly seasonal and vary greatly in magnitude between years. We have estimated the quantity and long-term rate of accumulation of catchment-derived sediment in the estuarine floodplain using the Holocene stratigraphic sequence determined from a series of sediment cores, dated with radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) methods.

Bourman:2010lofty,"Quaternary alluvial sediments occur within and on the flanks of the Mt Lofty Ranges of southern South Australia. Within the ranges they occupy colluvium-filled bedrock depressions, alluvial-fan sequences at hill/plain junctions and river terraces that flank major streamlines in both locations. Sediments ranging in age throughout the Quaternary have been identified, but this paper focuses on those deposits of Late Quaternary age. Luminescence dating has verified a Last Interglacial age (132–118 ka) for the most widespread of the alluvial units, the Pooraka Formation. A younger, Marine Isotope Stage 3, alluvial unit, in places containing bones of the extinct marsupial Diprotodon, has also been identified. Deposition of the alluvial sediments is associated with relatively warmer and wetter conditions, whereas the valleys that they occupy were eroded under drier climatic conditions. A more widespread occurrence of Stage 3 units is expected to be present but has not yet been verified. Cold, arid environments are inferred from the presence of dunes (∼18 ka) deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum when stream valleys were incised. Grey/black mid-Holocene alluvium (Waldeila Formation), forming present-day floodplains and low river terraces, equates with the Holocene Hypsithermal. The sequence of climatic changes revealed by these sediments is correlated with evidence of Late Quaternary climatic change from other Australian locations. The identification of equivalent units in different tectonic settings reveals that sedimentation is largely climatically driven although active tectonism may accelerate the supply of sediments available for transport.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In the first of these, prepared for a workshop in early 1989,1 conjectured that the fact that no evidence of human occupation older than c.5,000 BP had been found in the Shark Bay area may have been because the area was not occupied during the Pleistocene.

Bowler:1986radiocarbon,"Accurate radiocarbon dating of arid-zone playas is restricted by shortage of suitable organic matter. Analyses from two large systems in Australia (Lake Frome) and China (Qarhan playa in the Qaidam Basin) demonstrate the problems associated with the use of carbonates for dating. Organic carbon, although requiring treatment of large samples (1-2 kg), provides the most accurate basis for establishing chronologic control. In Qarhan, a deposit of halite averaging about 30 m thick, extends over an area of 5800 km2. Carbonate in the system is dominantly derived as clastics from loess transported by northwesterly winds. The large component of dead carbon thus involved explains anomalous patterns of dates derived from these materials. Such results are consistently much older than those based on organic carbon. In Lake Frome, subject to a more maritime climate in central Australia, the carbonate component is dominantly authigenic lacustrine in origin contaminated by a small detrital component. It provides ages about one half-life older than those from organic carbon. The sequence from Qarhan, supplemented by evidence of lacustral (pluvial) episodes in two other sub-basins in Qaidam, Kunteyi and Xiao Qaidam, illustrates the presence there of expanded waterbodies persisting from at least 40,000 to about 15,000 yr B.P. in areas where little surface-water persists today. The large evaporite deposits formed between about 25,000 to sometime after 15,000 yr B.P. Holocene climate appears to have remained hyperarid like that of today. At Lake Frome, an early lacustral phase gave way before 18,000 yr B.P. to drying and aeolian activity. Water had returned to the system by 16,000 yr B.P. signalling a decline if not the end of aridity. Lacustrine conditions persisted through early Holocene with drying and development of playa facies about 7000 yr B.P. After a brief return to lacustrine conditions between about 6000-4000 yr B.P. a dry playa environment has continued to the present day. The Frome and Qarhan playas, although in comparable latitudes lie in very different climatic and tectonic settings. Their palaeohydrologic records are neither in phase nor in distinct anti-phase emphasizing the complexity of comparing palaeoclimatic records from different circulation systems.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bowler:1986tyrell,"Lake Tyrrell, a saline playa in semi-arid north-western Victoria, records a long history in which a succession of lacustrine and aeolian environments can be related to past hydrologic variations. Cores through the saline evaporitic facies reveal a vertical pattern reflecting cyclic changes through time. Detrital clastics predominated during deep-water lacustral phases; evaporites were deposited during drying phases. A model, depicting surface-groundwater interaction during discrete stages of a typical cycle, relates changes in water depth, salinity and typical depositional facies. On the drying trend, the sequence evolves through carbonate to sulphate deposition. Progressive reduction in water level results in partial drying and production of the groundwater outcrop playa stage. Salt efflorescence and production of detrital pelletal clays provide parent materials for aeolian transport and dune building. Any additional fall in watertable permits downward leaching of salts, plant colonization of the lake floor and associated soil development. Facies variations reveal four hydrologic cycles within this saline sequence reflecting major climatic events in the Brunhes normal chron. The modern playa-salina phase represents a relatively late stage development. The mineral suite, including dolomitic carbonate, sulphide and gypsum-clay laminites, formed in this continental setting closely resembles facies described from coastal sebkhas, highlighting the problem of distinguishing between the origins of similar deposits in the ancient record.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Ages beyond 40 ka from the upper levels of the Lower Mungo unit at Lake Mungo and from the equivalent sands on the Outer Arumpo lunette provide upper limits to ages of burials inserted into the Lower Mungo sands (Mungo I and III).

Bowler:1998revisited,"The story of the Willandra Lakes is also the story of those ancient people who lived there. The landforms, sediments and soils provide the environmental framework within which the patterns of human occupation must be interpreted. The original stratigraphic system involved just two units, the Mungo and Zanci. Two additional units are now defined; one incorporating complexities between Mungo and Zanci, the Arumpo Unit, and a second to acknowledge the reality of a lake full phase near 18ka cal., postdating Zanci aridity of the last glacial maximum. This new unit is defined from Lake Mulurulu as the Mulurulu Unit. Improved facies analysis from data involving lake sediments, freshwater quartz beach sands (QBSs) and lake-dry pelletal clay dunes (PCDs) helps refine the sequence of environmental changes. Revision of radiocarbon chronologies with conversion to calendar years, and additional dates (radiocarbon, luminescence, amino acid racemisation) permit new age definitions of major environmental changes and human-land interactions. Following a lake-full phase (Lower Mungo time) from before about 55ka cal., a phase of PCD accumulation is dated to near 40ka cal. defining an early stage of hydrologic stress. Progressive water level oscillations continued (Arumpo time) culminating in major drying with deflation and extension of regional dune building over large areas of the Murray Basin near 20ka cal. (Zanci time). Freshwater returned temporarily to the Willandra lakes about 18?19ka cal. Throughout the period 25?19ka cal. spanning the glacial maximum, the apparent absence of fish and unionid mussels may reflect major temperature depression corresponding also to the period of maximum aridity. The ecological stress experienced at this time had an immense impact on the landscape, plants and especially larger animals, requiring new adaptive responses from human occupants. Early grinding techniques, pre-dating evidence of seed grinding, are suggested. Reconstruction of the sedimentary sequence at the main archaeological site at Joulni reveals a pre-Mungo unit deep in the sequence of a system developed by barrier construction isolating the Joulni Plain from the main lake. Analogous conditions at Lake Victoria today mirror development of the Joulni archaeological site. Oldest artefacts occurring within this un-named unit are dated beyond 45ka cal. Human occupation on the lakeshore barrier system at Lake Mungo involved aquatic harvesting (fish and shellfish) associated with human burials before the onset of PCD deposition, pre-40ka-cal. The association here of the complex burial ritual (Mungo III) involving anointing with ochre at this time presents one of the dramatic mysteries of ancient human cultural development.

Bowler:2003change,"Australia's oldest human remains, found at Lake Mungo, include the world's oldest ritual ochre burial (Mungo III)1 and the first recorded cremation (Mungo I)2. Until now, the importance of these finds has been constrained by limited chronologies and palaeoenvironmental information3. Mungo III, the source of the world's oldest human mitochondrial DNA4, has been variously estimated at 30 thousand years (kyr) old1, 42–45 kyr old5,6 and 62  6 kyr old7,8, while radiocarbon estimates placed the Mungo I cremation near 20–26 kyr ago2,9,10. Here we report a new series of 25 optical ages showing that both burials occurred at 40  2 kyr ago and that humans were present at Lake Mungo by 50–46 kyr ago, synchronously with, or soon after, initial occupation of northern11,12 and western Australia13. Stratigraphic evidence indicates fluctuations between lake-full and drier conditions from 50 to 40 kyr ago, simultaneously with increased dust deposition, human arrival and continent-wide extinction of the megafauna14,15. This was followed by sustained aridity between 40 and 30 kyr ago. This new chronology corrects previous estimates for human burials at this important site and provides a new picture of Homo sapiens adapting to deteriorating climate in the world's driest inhabited continent.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Bowler:2012wind,"Using lakes and dry basins for discerning the patterns of climatic change faces a number of challenges. Study of the Willandra basins (Figures 1 and 2) involves reconstruction of their environmental history and its relationship to controlling climatic change. The various methods for data interpretation and hydrologic reconstruction have been discussed elsewhere (Bowler 1971, 1998). In early evaluation, the history of the Willandra Lakes was summarised in terms of three major stratigraphic units, each related to a major cycle of hydrologic change. The units Golgol, Mungo and Zanci were designated as responsible for the major stratigraphic events in the history of the system (Bowler 1971).The Zanci drying phase was directly related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the period of maximum ice extent in the Northern Hemisphere (Clark et al. 2009), glacial ice on Kosciuszko (Barrows et al. 2001) and lowest sea level (Lambeck and Chappell 2001). In later revisions, Bowler (1998) defined an Arumpo unit between Mungo and Zanci, and a final Mulurulu unit to account for evidence of late-stage filling especially in Lake Mulurulu. ...

Boyd:1990dalhousie,"Sediment sequences from sites in Central Australia, one of the more arid parts of the world, have only recently been investigated for their Quaternary fossil pollen content and results from such research have not previously been published. This paper reports preliminary results from one of the sites being currently investigated, Dalhousie Springs, a major group of Great Artesian Basin mound springs in northern South Australia, where organic swamp deposits are associated with artesian spring outflows. These sediments are extremely unusual in this arid environment and offer both a unique opportunity to examine aspects of the late Quaternary vegetational history in the arid zone of Australia and a novel approach to arid region Quaternary environment studies. Results from this site primarily reflect the local swamp history of the last 2000 years or so; inferred vegetation changes largely represent changes in water flow from the spring feeding this swamp and the consequential growth of the swamp. These results demonstrate the potential for using spring-related sediments in the application of pollen analysis in the study of arid land palaeoenvironments.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Boyd:2008transport,"Deep-water sands form a new frontier for marine geology and petroleum exploration, but how does sand reach the deep sea? Existing geological models predict that deep-water sands are mainly supplied from rivers during times of low sea level, or by incision of canyons into the shelf to tap river or longshore-transport sand sources. Here, we demonstrate that at high sea level, southeast Australian deep-water sands are delivered by a wave-driven coastal transport system, interacting with estuarine ebb tidal flows, that transports sand over the shelf edge at a change in margin orientation. Discovery of this new process results from an investigation that combines multibeam acoustic, microfaunal, zircon and luminescence dating, oceanographic, Landsat, remotely operated vehicle, and sediment property methods. Our longshore transport-driven model is capable of forecasting new locations for deep-water sand deposits in a predictive paleoclimatic and paleotectonic setting.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Brardinoni:2020disturbance,"We examine the sensitivity of 10Be concentrations (and derived denudation rates), to debris‐flow and anthropogenic perturbations in steep settings of the Eastern Alps, and explore possible relations with structural geomorphic connectivity. Using cosmogenic 10Be as a tracer for functional geomorphic connectivity, we conduct sampling replications across four seasons in Gadria, Strimm and Allitz Creek. Sampling sites encompass a range of structural connectivity configurations, including the conditioning of a sackung, all assessed through a geomorphometric index (IC). By combining information on contemporary depth of erosion and sediment yield, disturbance history and post‐LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) sedimentation rates, we constrain the effects of debris‐flow disturbance on 10Be concentrations at the Gadria sites. Here, we argue that bedrock weakening imparted by the sackung promotes high depth of erosion. Consequently, debris flows recruit sediment beyond the critical depth of spallogenic production (e.g., >3 m), which in turn, episodically, due to predominantly muogenic production pathways, lowers 10Be concentration by a factor of 4, for at least 2 years. ...

Brill:2017washover,"Reliable age dating of coastal sedimentary landforms is crucial for inferring storm frequencies and magnitudes from geological archives. However, in highly energetic coastal settings, radiocarbon dating is often biased by reworking and/or poorly constrained marine reservoir effects. Due to this, most cyclone-driven sediment archives from the semiarid coast of NW Australia - a region frequently affected by tropical cyclones but with a historical record limited to ~150 a, and therefore strongly in need of long-term data inferred from geological evidence - are affected by chronological inaccuracies. Optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL) may overcome these shortcomings by dating the transport of sediment directly. In turn it may be related to other challenges when applied to cyclone deposits from semiarid environments. The cyclone-induced washover fans at Point Lefroy, NW Australia, are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of coral fragments, shell hash and siliciclastic sand. This makes them particularly prone to high dose scatter resulting from a combination of partial bleaching, sediment mixing and dose-rate heterogeneity. ....

Brocard:2021guatemala,"The presence of a mountain affects the circulation of water in the atmosphere and over the land surface. These effects are felt over some distance, beyond the extent of the mountain, controlling precipitation delivery and river incision over surrounding landmasses. The rise of a new mountain range therefore affects the erosion of pre-existing mountains located in close proximity. We document here this phenomenon in the mountains of Central Guatemala. The 40Ar-39Ar dating of lava flows shows that two parallel, closely spaced mountain ranges formed during two consecutive pulses of single-stepped uplift, one from 12 to 7 Ma, and the second one since 7 Ma. The distribution of erosion rates derived from the analysis of detrital cosmogenic 10Be in river sediments shows that the younger range erodes faster (~300 m/My) than the older one (20–150 m/My), and that erosion correlates with the amount of precipitation. Moisture tracking form the Caribbean Sea is intercepted by the younger range, which casts a rain shadow over the older one. The analysis of river long-profiles provides a record of longer-term interactions between the two ranges. The rivers that drain the older range were diverted by the younger range during the early stages of its rise. ... [_truncated_]",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2023-01-11 09:27:51.748 +0100
Brockwell:2001phd,"This thesis investigates settlement patterns and mobility strategies on the lower Adelaide River in the late Holocene period. As earth mounds are the dominant site type in the study area and have a chronology spanning at least 4000 years, they provide opportunities for research into Aboriginal adaptive strategies in an environment that changed dramatically over the mid to late Holocene period. Earth mounds have been reported from a number of locations in northern Australia, but until now have not been studied intensively. Several themes raised by the literature in relation to the earth mounds in both northern and southern Australia will be addressed, including location, morphology, chronology, origins and the role that earth mounds play in wider settlement systems. The earth mounds are located next to the vast floodplains of the Adelaide River, one of the major tropical rivers draining the flat coastal plains of the north. The floodplains of the northern rivers underwent dynamic environmental change from extensive mangrove swamps in the mid Holocene, through a variable estuarine and freshwater mosaic environment c. 3000 years ago, to the freshwater floodplains that are extant today. Geomorphological research into floodplain evolution in northern Australia has provided a framework within which the archaeology can be interpreted. I will argue that the earth mounds represent base camps and that occupation of the floodplain margins has been the major settlement strategy in the region from at least 4000 years ago until the recent past. However within that time the occupants of the earth mounds have adapted their foraging patterns and altered their mobility strategies according to floodplain conditions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This paper presents the analyses of the cultural materials recovered from these two open sites, including those of invertebrate and vertebrate faunal remains, shell and stone artefacts, and pigment on artefacts. Interpretation of the data suggests that occupation was relatively short-lived. Differential representation of food resources indicates that each site was occupied in different seasons.

BronkRamsey:1995oxcal,"People usually study the chronologies of archaeological sites and geological sequences using many different kinds of evidence, taking into account calibrated radiocarbon dates, other dating methods and stratigraphic information. Many individual case studies demonstrate the value of using statistical methods to combine these different types of information. I have developed a computer program, OxCal, running under Windows 3.1 (for IBM PCs), that will perform both 14C calibration and calculate what extra information can be gained from stratigraphic evidence. The program can perform automatic wiggle matches and calculate probability distributions for samples in sequences and phases. The program is written in C++ and uses Bayesian statistics and Gibbs sampling for the calculations. The program is very easy to use, both for simple calibration and complex site analysis, and will produce graphical output from virtually any printer.",2023-06-07 13:21:55.322 +0200,2023-06-09 09:33:16.267 +0200

Brooke:2008beachmere,"The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating method was used to determine the geochronology of seven relict beach ridges that sit immediately behind the modern beach at Beachmere, a low-energy sandy coast within Moreton Bay, Queensland. Between 2600 +/- 400 and 1700 +/- 130 years ago, the shoreline eroded and foreshore sediment was deposited over the older beach deposit. Subsequently, there was a 1500-year period of shoreline progradation: the shoreline advanced 0.16 m/y between 1700 +/- 130 and 1140 +/- 80 years ago; and 0.41 m/y between 1140 +/- 80 and around 200 years ago. Shortly after 690 +/- 60 years ago, a series of well-developed regularly spaced beach ridges gave way to an intertidal flat and then deposition of a set of lower amplitude, closely spaced beach ridges. The younger ridges were deposited between 230 +/- 40 and 140 +/- 50 years ago, at a rate of around 1.06 m/y. During the last several decades, much of the Beachmere shoreline has eroded into these younger relict ridges. Drivers of these changes in shoreline sedimentary regime are yet to be accurately determined; however, it seems likely they are related to switches that occur in the nearshore sand transport pathway. Our results demonstrate the utility of the OSL method for providing insights into coastal change that occurred in the historical and recent geological period. Better understanding the tempo of shoreline change in the recent past is particularly relevant for assessments of vulnerability to erosion of rapidly developing, low-lying sandy coasts such as northern Moreton Bay.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Brooke:2008keppel,"Beach ridges at Keppel Bay, central Queensland, Australia, preserve a record of sediment accumulation from the historical period back to middle Holocene times. The ridges comprise fine, well-sorted, feldspar-rich quartz sand that was eroded from the Fitzroy River catchment, deposited in Keppel Bay during floods of the Fitzroy River, and reworked onshore into beach and foredune deposits by the prevailing currents, waves and wind. These floods have an average recurrence interval of at least 7 yr and are induced by the passage of cyclones onshore into the large Fitzroy catchment. The youngest series of beach ridges sit sub-parallel to the modern beach and comprise six accretional units, each unit formed by a set of ridges and delineated by prominent swales. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of beach ridges in these units indicate they were deposited in periods of rapid progradation approximately 1500, 1000, 450 and 230 yr BP, when there was an enhanced supply of sediment to the beach from the Fitzroy River via Keppel Bay. Estimates of the mass of sediment stored in the beach-ridge strandplain show that it represents a significant sediment store, potentially trapping the equivalent of 79% of the estimated long-term (100 yr) average annual bedload of the Fitzroy River that is deposited in Keppel Bay. ...

Brooke:2008moreton,"Indurated sand in the Late Quaternary coastal plain succession of northern Moreton Bay was examined in sand-mine pits, drillcores and the eroded bank of an estuarine channel. Samples show that the cements usually coat grains and partially infill interstitial pores. Distinctive cement habits reflect different constituents that are dominantly kaolinite and amorphous organic-rich complexes. Trace-metal concentrations in the cements are lower than previously reported for soils and estuarine sediments in the study region. Optically stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence ages of these deposits indicate that pedogenic induration occurs over long periods, up to approximately 90 000 years, with only incipient induration evident in deposits 16 000 - 2600 years old. However, the rate of induration is far higher in relatively coarse channel fill, in which mineral and amorphous organic-rich cements have precipitated from shallow groundwater that flowed laterally through the deposit. The degree of induration, therefore, is strongly influenced by the original depositional texture and morphology of deposits, with well-indurated gravely channel fill (76 700 +/- 6500 y), at least 2 m thick, sitting adjacent to medium-grained sand probably of dune origin, which contains a 30 cm-thick induration horizon (98 000 +/- 9900 y).",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Brooke:2014aeolianite,"Aeolianite successions of low-gradient continental margins commonly show complex records of coastal dune deposition linked to a wide range of sea-level positions and climatic periods of the middle and late Pleistocene, recording both regional and broader-scale drivers of sediment production, coastal dune development and landform preservation. To better characterise the general pattern of sedimentation that occurs over Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles on low-gradient, temperate carbonate continental shelves we examine the morphology, stratigraphy and age of aeolianite deposits in the Perth region, Western Australia. This includes an analysis of well-defined drowned coastal landforms preserved on the adjacent shelf. New and previously published optical ages provide a preliminary timeframe for the deposition of aeolianite in the Perth region and on Rottnest Island, 17 km offshore. ...

Brooke:2015moreton,"Moreton Island and several other large siliceous sand dune islands and mainland barrier deposits in SE Queensland represent the distal, onshore component of an extensive Quaternary continental shelf sediment system. This sediment has been transported up to 1000 km along the coast and shelf of SE Australia over multiple glacioeustatic sea-level cycles. Stratigraphic relationships and a preliminary Optically Stimulated Luminance (OSL) chronology for Moreton Island indicate a middle Pleistocene age for the large majority of the deposit. Dune units exposed in the centre of the island and on the east coast have OSL ages that indicate deposition occurred between approximately 540 ka and 350 ka BP, and at around 96+/-10 ka BP. Much of the southern half of the island has a veneer of much younger sediment, with OSL ages of 0.90+/-0.11 ka, 1.28+/-0.16 ka, 5.75+/-0.53 ka and <0.45 ka BP. The younger deposits were partially derived from the reworking of the upper leached zone of the much older dunes. A large parabolic dune at the northern end of the island, OSL age of 9.90+/-1.0 ka BP, and palaeosol exposures that extend below present sea level suggest the Pleistocene dunes were sourced from shorelines positioned several to tens of metres lower than, and up to few kilometres seaward of the present shoreline. Given the lower gradient of the inner shelf a few km seaward of the island, it seems likely that periods of intermediate sea level (e.g. ~20 m below present) produced strongly positive onshore sediment budgets and the mobilisation of dunes inland to form much of what now comprises Moreton Island. The new OSL ages and comprehensive OSL chronology for the Cooloola deposit, 100 km north of Moreton Island, indicate that the bulk of the coastal dune deposits in SE Queensland were emplaced between approximately 540 ka BP and prior to the Last Interglacial. This chronostratigraphic information improves our fundamental understanding of long-term sediment transport and accumulation on large-scale continental shelf sediment systems.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Brooke:2019strandplains,"Northeastern Queensland is a far-field site from ice caps formed during the Last Glacial. However, the region has experienced glacio-hydroisostatically driven coastal elevation change during the Holocene that generated a distinctive relative sea-level record. We tested whether this subtle vertical movement of the coast is recorded in the morphology and stratigraphy of the beach-ridge strandplain at Cowley Beach, which comprises a series of 36 prominent and several subdued or truncated beach ridges. Previous studies have shown that the strandplain records the long-term progradation of the coast, with the ridges comprising coarse-medium sand that was deposited during both fairweather (foreshore and berm facies) and tropical cyclone events (erosional unconformities; storm-surge deposits) over the past approximately 7 ka. We utilised a fine-scale digital elevation model of the strandplain to examine beach ridge morphology and to compare the elevation pattern with published Holocene sea-level data for the region. The overall elevation pattern of the strandplain surface is consistent with the regional sea-level history, that includes a highstand at around 6 ka BP generated by isostatic uplift, and the elevation of the berm facies matches well robust coral sea-level indicator data. We also modelled the strandplain topographic patterns that would result under stable and continually rising Holocene sea-levels. The frequencies of elevation classes across the strandplain are normally distributed when the strandplain is deposited during a period of stable sea level, and negatively skewed with a continually rising sea level, consistent with the expected patterns. The results indicate the sensitivity of the elevation of the top of the berm facies preserved in beach ridges to subtle changes in sea level (tens of cm over a thousand years). Our results further underline the utility of beach-ridge strandplains, a globally distributed coastal landform, for building relatively detailed regional records of sea level during the Holocene at sites currently lacking this information.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Denudation processes in an agricultural watershed (Cayaguás River Basin, Puerto Rico) and a matched undisturbed watershed (Icacos River Basin) were compared using 10Be concentrations in quartz for various size fractions of bed material. The coarse fractions in both watersheds bear the imprint of long subsurface residence times. Fine material from old shallow soils contributes little, however, to the present-day sediment output of the Cayaguás. This confirms the recent and presumably anthropogenic origin of the modern high denudation rate in the Cayaguás Basin and suggests that pre-agricultural erosional conditions were comparable to those of the present-day Icacos.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Bryant:1992sandon,"In New South Wales there has been an elusive search for coastal deposits that might substantiate an elevated Holocene sea-level. Chronostratigraphic evidence is presented for estuarine and beach deposits raised more than 1 and 2 m respectively above Australian Height Datum around Sandon Point, New South Wales, between 6900 and 1520 BP. The chronology is based upon  14C dating of shell and in situ mangrove stumps, and upon thermoluminescence dating of quartz sand. These elevations concur with other results determined along the east coast of Australia and in the south Pacific. Moreover the Holocene beach sediments lie above Pleistocene aeolian sand dating between 25 300 and 32 700 BP and estuarine mud which must be at least Last Interglacial in age. The latter units also lie more than 2 m above Australian Height Datum. Fossil coral found along the adjacent coast plus the elevation and orientation of the raised marine deposits imply that ocean temperature was warmer around 2800 BP by up to 2°C, that sea-levels from 6000 to 1500 BP were over 1 m higher than present, and that a benign northeast swell may have dominated in the mid-Holocene.

Buckman:2009wilson,"An elevated valley-fill peat bog (Wilson Bog) near Mount Lofty, South Australia, failed in November 2005 following a flooding event, and exposed representative sections of the sediment infill. Two distinct units were revealed: 2 m of coarse-grained, siliciclastic sand/gravel, overlain by 2 m of peat.Asimple charcoal extraction technique based on floatation and skimming was developed to extract coarse charcoal from coarse-grained gravels to determine the palaeofire record at a proximal site of sedimentation. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of basal sediments revealed a minimum age of deposition of 7.02 +0.50 --0.56 ka, while the oldest charcoal peak yielded a radiocarbon age of 6000--5740 cal. yr BP. The lower half of the siliciclastic unit contains three distinct charcoal peaks suggesting there were infrequent but intense fires associated with wetter conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum 8000--5000 years ago. The period from 4000 to 2000 cal. yr BP is characterised by more frequent charcoal peaks and higher background levels of charcoal, which is consistent withmore regular but less intense fires during drier, cooler conditions. The sharp transition from siliciclastic sedimentation to peat formation began ~1200 cal. yr BP, which may relate to a return to wetter conditions. However, fire frequency appears to have increased in this time suggesting augmentation by anthropogenic or ENSO-related factors. Charcoal-rich layers in the siliciclastic unit are associated with poorly sorted, bimodal sediments with high proportions of clay, silt and gravel, which supports the hypothesis that there is an association between past fire events and rapid, coarse-grained, post-fire aggradation. By analogy with active colluvial aggradation following recent fires at nearbyMount Bold, it is evident that fire plays a significant role in hillslope destabilization and subsequent sediment movement, leading to rapid valley- fill aggradation -- a chain of events to which we apply the term 'pyrocolluviation'.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Two records cover the whole of the 30 000 year history of the landscape while two others provide evidence of change within the Holocene. A great deal of variation within the landscape is revealed, both temporally and spatially, with opportunities for human exploitation through the whole recorded period. Although most features of the records can be explained by natural landscape development and climate change, some human modification can be suggested from around the Pleistocene--Holocene transition while more obvious indications of management relating to eel aquaculture are evident from about 4000 cal. yr BP that appear to include adaptations to the onset of a drier and more variable climate.

We provide an assessment of the relative cleanliness of the species and a range of lift and drag coefficient values for use in metabolic power output modelling. The species assessed have aerodynamic cleanliness optimisations that are appropriate to the range of Reynolds' numbers in which bats fly. Head/body relative cleanliness was consistent with, and functionally appropriate to, aspects of species foraging niche such as foraging strategy. Cleanliness of face and fineness ratio of head and body were found to be related to minimum foraging drag. Blending of the wing and body, the presence of a wing/body fillet and the texture of the pelage were found to be important. The aerodynamic optimisation of ears and tail membrane were found to correlate with foraging strategy. The interceptors had optimisations for minimum drag generation consistent with their higher foraging flight speed. Rather than being optimised for minimum drag, the air-superiority bats' tails and ears were consistent with their highly agile but slower-foraging flight speeds. Surface bats were characterised by the absence of optimisations for low drag.

Bulmer:1978thesis,"The thesis is a study of archaeological evidence from the vicinity of Port Moresby, the results of fieldwork between 1968 and 1972. Survey data from 95 archaeological sites, surface collections of potsherds and stone artefacts from 67 of these, and data from three archaeological excavations are analysed and compared. The evidence shows that the local population was formerly living in different places, that communities therefore were positioned differently in respect to local ecological zones, particularly the inland river plains, and that they formerly used a markedly different style of pottery. The thesis examines questions of the possible cause of changes to settlement patterns, ecology, and pottery styles resulting in the situation known from the late 19th century. Oral histories of the Koita and Motu are considered for the light they cast on past inter-communty variation and change. These traditions suggest that the situation of the late Proto-historic period, of heavy dependence upon imported food based on the specialist manufacture of shell ornaments and pottery, was of relatively recent origin. The archaeological evidence tends to support this iew. Three archaeological excavations directed by the author, at Nebira and Eriama, about 10 km inland near the Laloki River, and at Taurama on the coast, provide some direct evidence of change in pottery style and ecological orientation, while the survey data enables a reconstruction of past settlement patterns through pottery style changes. The pottery style sequence i sput into three general periods of time: an Early period, from about 2,000 to 1,000 years ago, a Middle period from about 1,000 to 1,500 A.D., and a Proto-historic period from about 1500 A.D. to the late 19th century. ...

Archaeological evidence for prehistoric trade and economic change is questioned. Changes in settlement distribution following the 16th century suggest that an increased dependence on trade may relate to this later period.

In order to assess recent changes in erosion rate, and also to predict future erosion dynamics, it is important to quantify long-term, background erosion. Current research on erosion in New Zealand predominantly covers short-term (100 yrs) erosion dynamics and Myr dynamics from thermochronological proxy data. Without competent medium-term denudation data for New Zealand, it is uncertain which variables (climate, anthropogenic disturbance of the landscape, tectonic uplift, lithological, or geomorphic characteristics) exert the dominant control on denudation in New Zealand.

The aim of the project is to study the introduction and subsequent cultural development of the Trobriand culture. Central questions at issue include the time of initial colonization of the area; the existence or non-existence oflong-term cultural continuity in the islands as revealed by the archaeological record; the identification of possible hiatuses in the cultural development which may be associated with e.g. the influx of intrusive populations (as revealed by ongoing genetic studies of the skeletal material). In the initial stage, radiocarbon dates (AMS) and post mortem DNA-analyses on skeletal remains will form a crucial fundament for the planning of the forthcoming investigations.

The chronology produced here is consistent with age estimates from a handful of dated sites within the wider Kalahari basin. The Mode 3 to Mode 5 (Later Stone Age, LSA) relationship at one site, Chavuma, is unlikely to be a continuous transition as previously thought. Instead we find a significant chronological hiatus between MSA material deposited at 66.5 ± 9.9 ka and LSA material deposited at 16.7 ± 2.6 ka.

Burrows:1990aranuian,"Two pollen analyses are described from sediments in the mires at Quagmire Tarn and Windy Tarn, on the Prospect Hill plateau, upper Rakaia Valley, Canterbury. The sediments span most of the Aranuian period. Macrofossils from Quagmire Tarn supplementthe pollen data. Thev egetation sequences from the two sites are generally similar, although the Windy Tarn sequence begins later than that of Quagmire Tarn and differs in some details. The post-Otiran dominant pollen assemblages at Quagmire Tarn are: Poaceae and Coprosma (beginning probably about 13 000 yr B.P.) -> Halocarpus (about 10000 yr B.P.) -> Phyllocladus and 'Podocarpus' (just after 10 000 yr RP.) -> Nothofagus menziesii and N.fusca-type (about 2000 yr B.P.) -> Poaceae, Cypcraceae, Asteraceae, and Apiaceae (beginning about 860 yr B.P.). Changes in the sediments, pollen assemblages, and macrofossils are correlated with the early Aranuian glacial history of the region, with subsequent climatic changes, and with the fire history. The fire history is deduced from approximate ages estimated from depths of charcoal horizons in the Quagmire Tarn sediment column and radiocarbon dates for charcoal from palaeosols on the edge of the Prospect Hill plateau. Fires are thought to have occurred at Prospect Hill about 5800, 3800, 3500, 2600, and 860 yr B.P. Climatic shifts are thought to bethe cause of changes from Poaceae, Coprosma (cold, dry) -> Halocarpus (cool, moist) -> Phyllocladus, 'Podocarpus' (evenly mild, moist). The time-transgressive expansion of Nothofagus spp. in the Canterbury mountains requires a more complex explanation which includes the proximity of stands ofthese species during the Otira Glaciation and slow Aranuian migration, the requirement for infection of seedlings by ectomycorrhizas, and possible local shifts across climatic thresholds (towards more variable conditions).

Burrows:2014humification,"The identification of wetter and drier phases from the last deglaciation to the Late Holocene has been a valuable outcome of palaeoenvironmental (chiefly palynological) studies of northeastern Australia conducted over the past 40 years. Few studies have, however, focussed on the identification of wetter and drier phases in the wet tropics, and none have set their focus on the last 4000 years, a period when northeastern Australia is generally accepted to have experienced increased El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity. The present study provides this palaeoclimatic information using the degree of peat humification as the main palaeoclimatic proxy. To identify regional climatic signals in the peat record and differentiate these from local signals induced by particular basin hydrology or ecology, sedimentary sequences from two geographically separated swamps on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland are examined. Wet and dry shifts are detected in the humification records for Bromfield Swamp (core BSAT03) and Mount Quincan crater swamp (Q2). Seventeen wet shifts are detected in both records with 12 shifts showing good cross-correlation at the following dates (with 2σ range): 3990/3960 (4090--3850), 3480/3550 (3640--3420), 2950/2990 (3080--2790), 2860/2880 (2980--2700), 2560/2610 (2730--2450), 1880/1820 (2100--1740), 1430/1410 (1660--1320), 1170/1080 (1390--1020), 990/1010 (1100--790), 610/640 (710--490), 290/300 (330--180) and 120/150 (190--40) cal. yr BP.

Buscher:2013menderes,"Exhumation of rocks in extensional tectonic settings results from a combination of normal faulting and erosion but the relative contribution of these processes has rarely been quantified. Here we present new low-temperature thermochronological data and the first 10Be-based catchment-wide erosion rates from the Boz Dağ region in the central Menderes Massif, which has experienced NNE–SSW extension since the Miocene. The slip rate of the shallow-dipping Gediz detachment fault, which defines the northern flank of the Boz Dağ block, is 4.3 (+3.0/−1.2) mm a−1, as constrained by zircon (U–Th)/He ages of c. 4–2 Ma in the footwall. Apatite and zircon (U–Th)/He and fission-track ages from the northern flank of the Boz Dağ block yield exhumation rates of 0.6–2 km Ma−1 beneath the Gediz detachment, whereas those on the southern flank are only 0.2–0.6 km Ma−1. Erosion of catchments on the northern and southern flanks proceeds at rates of 80–180 and 330–460 mm ka−1, respectively. This marked contrast is a combined effect of the topographic asymmetry of the Boz Dağ block and differences in rock erodibility. If these erosion rates persisted in the past, rock exhumation on the northern flank occurred predominantly by tectonic denudation, whereas rocks on the southern flank were mainly exhumed by erosion.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Bussell:1988wanganui,"Two sites near Waverley, western North Island, provide a mid to late Holocene vegetational, climatic, and fire history for the area. A mid Holocene flora at Waverley Beach includes a local fossil Podocarpus totora forest preserved as in situ stumps exposed in Hauriri Terrace cover beds. Fossil pollen suggests the presence of surrounding podocarp-hardwood forest dominated by Beilschmiedia tawa(?) and Dacrydiwn cupressinum but with common Ascarina lucida and Dodonaea viscosa in the understorey, suggesting a maritime, moist, warm-temperate climate was present. At Waverley Beach, the local, dense forest phase of Podocarpus totara appears to have been eliminated by water table elevation following the post-glacial rise in sea level up to 6500 BP. The decline in abundance of Ascarina and Dodonaea pollen from the mid to late Holocene is suggestive of a milder climate during that period. Around Lake Waiau swamp, pre-clearance podocarp-hardwood forest was probably dominated by B. tawa(?), D. cupressinum, Prwnnopitys taxifolia, Metrosideros, and Knightia excelsa. Deforestation by Polynesian burning is recorded at 1 m depth in Lake Waiau swamp by the abrupt decline in arboreal pollen values. This event is poorly constrained by radiocarbon dating, and at present an age range of c. 685 CAL BP-210 BP is suggested. The scatter in radiocarbon ages for the Lake Waiau swamp peat provides a warning against the simple interpretation of ages of similar material, where few dates have been obtained. Fire activity at both sites is indicated by measurement of microscopic charcoal particle area. Pre-Polynesian fires may have been significant in affecting the vegetation composition. The chronology for dune-sand deposition does not correspond with previously described periods of dune formation. At Waverley Beach, dune-sand was deposited soon after 6600 BP and stopped prior to c. 5750 BP. A second period of dune-sand deposition occurred after 5700 BP. At Lake Waiau, dune movement blocked off Waiau Stream before c. 3500 BP; aeolian transport of sand continued for a short time after the lake was first formed.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
Butler:2007orange,"Break-up of the Gondwana supercontinent ~ 130 Ma ago resulted in the formation of new base levels for erosion around the coastline of southern Africa. Although the post-break-up denudational history has been quantified using low-temperature thermochronology, the more recent Quaternary record is currently poorly constrained. Cosmogenic-nuclide based estimates of denudation rates applicable over time scales of 104 - 106 years exist for some localities in southern Africa, but there have been no equivalent catchment-wide studies in the Orange basin, the primary drainage basin of the subcontinent. In this study a regional-scale picture of catchment-wide denudation based on l(,Be and 26A1 is presented that shows rates varying from ~ 2 to ~ 50 mm ka'1. These rates are consistent with existing cosmogenic-derived site-specific estimates, and are also compatible with the much longer term denudation record derived from low-temperature thermochronology. This record indicates generally low rates of denudation across southern Africa after a phase of locally high rates in the period after continental break-up. Despite the low rates reported here, it is evident that low-relief erosion surfaces in the Orange basin could not have survived unmodified over geological time scales, as implied in traditional denudation chronology approaches to landscape history. ...

The diversity andfrequency of taxa identified in the late Holocene Weld-RS-0731 charcoal assemblages correspond to known vegetation communities, similar to those found in the area today.

Byun:2015korean,"The processes involved in the development of high‐altitude, low‐relief areas (HLAs) are still poorly understood. Although cosmogenic nuclides have provided insights into the evolution of HLAs interpreted as paleo‐surfaces, most studies focus on estimating how slowly they erode and thereby their relative stability. To understand actual development processes of HLAs, we applied several techniques of cosmogenic nuclides in the Daegwanryeong Plateau, a well‐known HLA in the Korean Peninsula. Our denudation data from strath terraces, riverine sediments, soils, and tors provide the following conclusions: (1) bedrock incision rate in the plateau (~127 m Myr−1) is controlled by the incision rate of the western part of the Korean Peninsula, and is similar to the catchment‐wide denudation rate of the plateau (~93 m Myr−1); (2) the soil production function we observed shows weak depth dependency that may result from highly weathered bedrock coupled with frequent frost action driven by alpine climate; (3) a discrepancy between the soil production and catchment‐wide denudation rates implies morphological disequilibrium in the plateau; (4) the tors once regarded as fossil landforms of the Tertiary do not reflect Tertiary processes; and (5) when compared with those of global paleo‐surfaces (<20 m Myr−1), our rapid denudation rates suggest that the plateau cannot have maintained its probable initial paleo landscape, and thus is not a paleo‐surface. Our data contribute to understanding the surface processes of actively eroding upland landscapes as well as call into question conventional interpretations of supposed paleo‐surfaces around the world.

Cadd:2019tasmanian,"Tasmania's montane temperate rainforests contain some of Australia's most ancient and endemic flora. Recent landscape--scale fires have impacted a significant portion of these rainforest ecosystems. The complex and rugged topography of Tasmania results in a highly variable influence of fire across the landscape, rendering predictions of ecosystem response to fire difficult. We assess the role of topographic variation in buffering the influence of fire in these endemic rainforest communities. We developed a new 14 000--year (14--ka) palaeoecological dataset from Lake Perry, southern Tasmania, and compared it to neighbouring Lake Osborne (<250m distant) to examine how topographic variations influence fire and vegetation dynamics through time. Repeated fire events during the Holocene cause a decline in montane rainforest taxa at both sites; however, in the absence of fire, rainforest taxa are able to recover. Montane temperate rainforest taxa persisted at Lake Perry until European settlement, whilst these taxa were driven locally extinct and replaced by Eucalyptus species at Lake Osborne after 2.5 ka. Contiguous topographic fire refugia within the Lake Perry catchment probably provided areas of favourable microclimates that discouraged fire spread and supported the recovery of these montane temperate rainforests.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Cadd:2019thesis,"The timing and cause of megafauna extinctions across Australian, and indeed around the world, have been strongly debated particularly since Martin (1967) first implicated human agency as a major factor in megafauna disappearances. The cause of the demise of the megafauna has been the focus of many studies, yet no work to date has developed independent environmental and climate reconstructions from a single Australian location in relation to megafauna extinctions. Sedimentary records from wetlands provide a particularly powerful archive to examine terrestrial ecosystem change in response to internal and external drivers across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The presence of coprophilous fungi spores, such as Sporormiella, preserved in wetland sediments can indicate the local presence of large herbivorous, including extinct megafauna. Records of megafauna presence can then be coupled with palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological proxies to disentangle the influence of climate on terrestrial ecosystem change and the timing of megafauna disappearance. Sedimentary records that extend beyond the Holocene in Australia are rare. Rarer still are long, continuous, high-resolution records that extend beyond Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3; 57 -- 29 ka), a period of substantial significance in Australia that encompasses human arrival and megafauna extinctions. In this thesis I integrate a range of proxies from an 80,000 year old, well-dated, continuous sedimentary sequence from Welsby Lagoon, North Stradbroke Island to investigate the climate and environmental variability of subtropical eastern Australia from MIS4 to present. In this thesis I present, for the first time at a single location, records of inferred megafauna presence, local fire occurrence, vegetation change and independent local climate variability. Understanding the development of the wetland system and identification of changes in depositional environment at ca. 28 ka provide a robust basis for interpretation of proxies. During MIS4 and the Holocene fire is an important component of the surrounding landscape and drives vegetation change, with a more limited influence during MIS3 and MIS2. The largest changes in the vegetation around Welsby Lagoon occur between 55 -- 40 ka, in the absence of frequent fire and coincident with the timing of widespread human migration and megafauna extinction. The shifts in vegetation during this period are predominantly driven by changes in climate, as inferred from the δ13C of bulk sediment and the δ18O of aquatic cellulose. The climate of this period displays a high level of variability as well as a shift to drier climates at ca. 54 and again at 43 ka. In addition to driving changes in vegetation dynamics, Sporormiella disappeared from the record at this time, during a shift to drier climate conditions. Within chronological uncertainty, the changes in vegetation composition and hydroclimate at ca. 43 ka at Welsby Lagoon are concurrent with abrupt changes in the Darling River region and central Australia as well as five vegetation records from across the central and eastern Australia. The data suggest that climatic change was major contributor to megafauna and vegetation change during Marine Isotope Stage 3.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Cadd:2022application,"Wetland sediments are valuable archives of environmental change but can be challenging to date. Terrestrial macrofossils are often sparse, resulting in radiocarbon (14C) dating of less desirable organic fractions. An alternative approach for capturing changes in atmospheric 14C is the use of terrestrial microfossils. We 14C date pollen microfossils from two Australian wetland sediment sequences and compare these to ages from other sediment fractions (n = 56). For the Holocene Lake Werri Berri record, pollen 14C ages are consistent with 14C ages on bulk sediment and humic acids (n = 14), whilst Stable Polycyclic Aromatic Carbon (SPAC) 14C ages (n = 4) are significantly younger. For Welsby Lagoon, pollen concentrate 14C ages (n = 21) provide a stratigraphically coherent sequence back to 50 ka BP. 14C ages from humic acid and >100 μm fractions (n = 13) are inconsistent, and often substantially younger than pollen ages. Our comparison of Bayesian age-depth models, developed in Oxcal, Bacon and Undatable, highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the different programs for straightforward and more complex chrono-stratigraphic records. All models display broad similarities but differences in modeled age-uncertainty, particularly when age constraints are sparse.

Callahan:2019california,"Tributary creeks of the southern Sierra Nevada have pronounced knickpoints that separate the landscape into an alternating sequence of gently sloped treads and steeply sloped risers. These knickpoints and the surrounding “stepped topography” suggest that the landscape is still responding to Pleistocene changes in base level on main-stem rivers. We tested this hypothesis using cosmogenic nuclides and uranium isotopes measured in stream sediment from widely distributed locations. Catchment-scale erosion rates from the cosmogenic nuclides suggest that the treads are relict surfaces that have adjusted to a previous base level. Nevertheless, erosion rates of relict interfluves are similar to canyon incision rates, implying that relief is unchanging in the lower Kings and San Joaquin Rivers. In addition, our results suggest that much of the southern Sierra Nevada is in a state of arrested development: the landscape is not fully adjusted to—and moreover is not responding to— changes in base-level lowering in the canyons. We propose that this can be explained by a paucity of coarse sediment supply, which fails to provide sufficient tools for bedrock channel incision at knickpoints. We hypothesize that the lack of coarse sediment in channels is driven by intense weathering of the local granitic bedrock, which reduces the size of sediment supplied from hillslopes to the channels.

Camens:2017trace,"It is rapidly becoming apparent that the Late Pleistocene vertebrate trace fossil record of southern Australia is much more comprehensive than previously understood, and complements the skeletal fossil record with regard to the distribution of taxa in coastal environments and the palaeobiology of both extinct and extant organisms. We surveyed the majority of prospective Bridgewater Formation outcrops on Kangaroo Island in South Australia and discovered a trace fossil site preserving hundreds of individual traces. A minimum of ten different reptile, bird, and mammal taxa, as well as invertebrates, are represented at the site. Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence dating indicates that the dune in which the traces imprinted was deposited at the beginning of Marine Isotope Stage 5e (135.4 +/- 5.9 ka). The traces were made by several extinct taxa including large quadrupeds (most probably diprotodontids), short-faced (sthenurine) kangaroos, and thylacines, as well as extant taxa including possums, the Tasmanian Devil, goannas, shorebirds, and a variety of kangaroos. This site demonstrates that, even though vertebrate trace fossil sites do not often allow the same level of taxonomic differentiation as skeletal fossil deposits, they can nevertheless provide important information about taxon distribution and behavior that can be correlated and contrasted with skeletal fossil assemblages.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Carretier:2013andes,"Climate and topography control millennial-scale mountain erosion, but their relative impacts remain matters of debate. Conflicting results may be explained by the influence of the erosion threshold and daily variability of runoff on long-term erosion. However, there is a lack of data documenting these erosion factors. Here we report suspended-load measurements, derived decennial erosion rates, and 10Be-derived millennial erosion rates along an exceptional climatic gradient in the Andes of central Chile. Both erosion rates (decennial and millenial) follow the same latitudinal trend, and peak where the climate is temperate (mean runoff ∼500 mm yr−1). Both decennial and millennial erosion rates increase nonlinearly with slope toward a threshold of ∼0.55 m/m. The comparison of these erosion rates shows that the contribution of rare and strong erosive events to millennial erosion increases from 0\% in the humid zone to more than 90\% in the arid zone. Our data confirm the primary role of slope as erosion control even under contrasting climates and support the view that the influence of runoff variability on millennial erosion rates increases with aridity.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Carretier:2015chilean,"The effect of mean precipitation rate on erosion is debated. Three hypotheses may explain why the current erosion rate and runoff may be spatially uncorrelated: (1) the topography has reached a steady state for which the erosion rate pattern is determined by the uplift rate pattern; (2) the erosion rate only depends weakly on runoff; or (3) the studied catchments are experiencing different transient adjustments to uplift or to climate variations. In the Chilean Andes, between 27°S and 39°S, the mean annual runoff rates increase southwards from 0.01 to 2.6 m a−1 but the catchment averaged rates of decadal erosion (suspended sediment) and millennial erosion (10Be in river sand) peak at c. 0.25 mm a−1 for runoff c. 0.5 m a−1 and then decrease while runoff keeps increasing. Erosion rates increase non-linearly with the slope and weakly with the square root of the runoff. However, sediments trapped in the subduction trench suggest a correlation between the current runoff pattern and erosion over millions of years. The third hypothesis above may explain these different erosion rate patterns; the patterns seem consistent with, although not limited to, a model where the relief and erosion rate have first increased and then decreased in response to a period of uplift, at rates controlled by the mean precipitation rate.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Carretier:2015differences,"Cosmogenic nuclides in river sediment have been used to quantify catchment-mean erosion rates. Nevertheless, variable differences in 10Be concentrations according to grain size have been reported. We analyzed these differences in eleven catchments on the western side of the Andes, covering contrasting climates and slopes. The data include eight sand (0.5–1 mm) and gravel (1–3 cm) pairs and twelve sand (0.5–1 mm) and pebble (5–10 cm) pairs. The difference observed in three pairs can be explained by a difference in the provenance of the sand and coarser sediment. The other sand–pebble pairs show a lower 10Be concentration in the pebbles, except for one pair that shows similar concentrations. Two sand–gravel pairs show a lower 10Be concentration in the gravel and the other five pairs show a higher 10Be concentration in the gravel. Differences in climate do not reveal a particular influence on the 10Be concentration between pairs. The analysis supports a model where pebbles and gravel are mainly derived from catchment areas that are eroding at a faster rate. The five gravel samples with high 10Be concentrations probably contain gravel that were derived from the abrasion of cobbles exhumed at high elevations. In order to validate this model, further work should test if pebbles are preferentially exhumed from high erosion rate areas, and if the difference between pebbles with high 10Be concentrations and sand decreases when the erosion rate tends to be homogeneous within a catchment.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Carretier:2015heterogeneous,"Millennial catchment–mean erosion rates derived from terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides are generally based on the assumption that the lithologies of the parent rock each contain the same proportion of quartz. This is not always true for large catchments, in particular at the edge of mountainous plateaus where quartz‐rich basement rocks may adjoin sedimentary or volcano‐sedimentary rocks with low quartz content. The western Central Andes is an example of this type of situation. Different quartz contents may be taken into account by weighting the TCN production rates in the catchment. We recall the underlying theory and show that weighting the TCN production rate may also lead to bias in the case of a spatial correlation between erosion rate and lithology. We illustrate the difference between weighted and unweighted erosion rates for seven catchments (16 samples) in southern Peru and northern Chile and show variations up to a factor of 2 between both approaches. In this dataset, calculated erosion rates considering only granitoid outcrops are better correlated with catchment mean slopes than those obtained without taking into account the geological heterogeneity of the drained watershed. This dataset analysis demonstrates that weighting erosion rates by relative proportions of quartz is necessary to evaluate the uncertainties for calculated catchment–mean erosion rates and may reveal the correlation with geomorphic parameters.

Carretier:2019atacama,"Intense storms or earthquakes in mountains can supply large amounts of gravel to rivers. Gravel clasts then travel at different rates, with periods of storage and periods of displacement leading to their downstream dispersion over millennia. The rate of this dispersion controls the long-term downcutting rate in mountainous rivers as well as the grain-size signature of climate and tectonic variations in sedimentary basins. Yet, the millennial dispersion rates of gravel are poorly known. Here, we use 10Be concentrations measured in individual pebbles from a localized source along a 56 km-long canyon in the Central Andes to document the distribution of long-term gravel transit rates. We show that an inverse grain-size velocity relationship previously established from short-term tracer gravel in different rivers worldwide can be extrapolated to the long-term transit rates in the Aroma River, suggesting some universality of this relationship. Gravel are also dispersed by large differences in the mean transport rates independent of gravel size, highlighting that some gravel rest at the river surface over tens of thousands of years. These different transport rates imply a strong spreading of the gravel plumes, providing direct proof for the long-term river buffering of sediment signals between mountainous sources and sedimentary basins. The inferred distribution of residence times suggests the first evidence of anomalous diffusion in gravel transport over long timespans.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Carter:2004thesis,"This dissertation describes analyses and contextualises the results of archaeological investigations carried out between 1998 and 2000 on Mer and Dauar in Torres Strait. Along with Waier these small volcanic islands are commonly known as the Murray Islands, and form the most eastern group of the formation of islands scattered between northeastern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea. Unlike the research into human occupation and subsistence in Australia and New Guinea, the archaeology of the Torres Strait Islands is by contrast a relatively recent academic pursuit. Over the last 30 years various researchers have postulated the timing of first human occupation of Torres Strait, the development of maritime and horticultural subsistence systems and the emergence of ethnohistorically documented trade networks. A lack of archaeological data, however, has prevented informed consideration of these issues. This dissertation presents the results of the first systematic archaeological excavations undertaken in the Eastern Torres Strait, and includes the first detailed radiocarbon chronological sequence for the Murray Islands and for the Torres Strait more generally. The excavations on Dauar revealed extensive archaeological deposits of marine subsistence remains, and previously unrecorded material culture of Torres Strait; most notably, several sherds of earthenware pottery. These artefacts have provided new opportunities for investigating the traditional trade and exchange networks between the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea that existed at the time of European contact. The Murray Islands data illustrates the existence of a maritime subsistence base from the time of first human occupation now securely dated to almost 3000 years BP. Although plant macrofossils where absent during the excavations, evidence for horticultural subsistence on Dauar was identified through the extraction and identification of plant phytoliths and starch grains from excavated sediment samples. ...

Carvalho:2019shoalhaven,"Prograded barriers are depositional coastal landforms which have the potential to reveal changes in the primary drivers of coastal evolution within their varied morphology. Beach ridges and intervening swales preserve paleoenvironmental records of coastal processes, relative sea level and storm events. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz grains, airborne LiDAR-derived morphology, and sediment texture and mineralogy reveal four different periods of morpho-sedimentary progradation history in the Shoalhaven barrier system in southeastern Australia. The barrier is composed of approximately 40 ridges that occupy an area of 15.2 km2, comprising an estimated sand volume of approximately 88,000,000 m3 above mean sea level. OSL dating of ten samples taken from a 940-m long transect across the Holocene system indicated that the barrier prograded at a slow rate of approximately 0.12 m/yr from 6130 +/- 330 to 2400 +/- 130 years ago and subsequently at a higher rate of 0.22 m/yr until 600 +/- 130 years ago. More recently, an increase in historical accumulation and progradation rates has favoured development of an anomalously high foredune fronting the system with the formation of lower ridges in the past two centuries. Increasing angularity and feldspar content observed via Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and determined using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively, imply a transition in sediment supply. Progradation has been sustained through delivery and reworking of marine sediments from offshore following the marine transgression, subsequently augmented by fluvial sands discharged to the coast by the Shoalhaven River. The adjustment in progradational rates and sediment provenance influenced the morphology and spacing of individual ridges and the regressive system as a whole. Average progradation rates for the Shoalhaven barrier, revised from those previously reported using radiocarbon dating, are considered lower than most of barriers studied in similar coastal environments around Australia, indicating the different ways that similar progradation systems have evolved.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Chadwick:2013weathering,"The spacing of hills and valleys reflects the competition between disturbance-driven (or diffusive) transport on hillslopes and concentrative (or advective) transport in valleys, although the underlying lithologic, tectonic, and climatic controls have not been untangled. Here, we measure geochemical and geomorphic properties of catchments in Kruger National Park, South Africa, where granitic lithology and erosion rates are invariant, enabling us to evaluate how varying mean annual precipitation (MAP = 470 mm, 550 mm, and 730 mm) impacts hill-valley spacing or landscape dissection. Catchment-averaged erosion rates, based on 10Be concentrations in river sands, are low (3–6 m/m.y.) and vary minimally across the three sites. Our lidar-derived slope-area analyses reveal that hillslopes in the dry site are gentle (3\%) and short, such that the terrain is low relief and appears highly dissected. With increasing rainfall, hillslopes lengthen and increase in gradient (6\%–8\%), resulting in less-dissected, higher-relief catchments. The chemical depletion fraction of hilltop regoliths increases with rainfall, from 0.3 to 0.7, reflecting a climate-driven increase in chemical relative to physical erosion. Soil catenas also vary systematically with climate as we observe relatively uniform soil properties in the dry site that contrast with leached sandy crests and upper slopes coupled with downslope clay accumulation zones in the intermediate and wet sites. The geomorphic texture of this slow-eroding, granitic landscape appears to be set by climate-driven feedbacks among chemical weathering, regolith fabric differentiation, hydrological routing, and sediment transport that enhance the vigor of hillslope sediment transport relative to valley-forming processes for wetter climates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Chalson:1991thesis,"A review of the literature relevant to the Late Quaternary environmental history of the highland region of New South Wales has been undertaken. Studies of Quaternary vegetation history in Australia have been hampered by the difficulty in identifying the pollen of the major family which dominates the south-eastern portion of the continent, the Myrtaceae. Few long palynological records have been published from sites in N.S.W. and thus data over 25 000 years old is sparse. Studies concerning climatic change in the Holocene period are hampered by the small amplitude of possible changes and considerable controversy is revealed in the literature. Pollen analysis of sediment cores from a series of swamps in an altitudinal sequence across the Blue Mountains was undertaken. The altitude change across the study region is associated with a strong climatic gradient and thus these sites were sensitive to small scale climatically induced changes in the vegetation which were recorded in the pollen spectra. The study region is dominated by species of the family Myrtaceae and in order to analyse vegetation change, it was necessary to develop a method to identify dispersed pollen of this family to species level. The reference collection enabled identification of 79 percent of the dispersed Myrtaceae types of pollen. A vegetation, charcoal and environmental history of the local area immediately surrounding each of the eight swamps in the study has been reconstructed. The information from all of these sites has been combined to produce a climatic history of the study region. One site has a basal date of 34 000 BP and, thus a new long palynological record is included in this study. From this long palynological record it was concluded that temperatures reached a minimum of approximately 7.6 degrees C below modern values in the coldest month and approximately 9.4 degrees C below modern in the hottest month between 34 000 BP and 32 000 BP. A series of small fluctuations in effective precipitation between 11 000 BP and the present have been demonstrated and a model for these oscillations proposed. Some analysis of the relationship between climate and vegetation change and the charcoal record has been undertaken.

During the 27-16 k cal. yr BP period, a shrubland of Cassinia arcuata with some grasses was present. The lack of eucalypts during the height of the last glacial period suggests a cold, arid climate and agrees with estimates that the rainfall was about half that of today.

The nature of the accumulating sediments and their algal and fungal spore content can be interpreted to refl ect the hydrological history of the swamp. An initial establishment period of 8,000 to 5,500 year ago was followed by a permanent pool of water too deep for the sedgeland swamp vegetation, from 5,500 to 2,400 years ago and then a vegetated swamp that dried out periodically, from 2,400 years ago to present, as it does today. Changes in the sediments and algae/fungi record suggest a wetter early Holocene and a drier mid-late Holocene climate, with an intensification of the dry periods about 2,500 years ago. This pattern of change seems to refl ect regional climatic change. There is very little change in the less sensitive sclerophyllous vegetation. The likely impact of rising Holocene sea levels on this near-coastal environment is discussed.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Mean February temperature reconstructions show a maximum inferred cooling of c. ~6.5 degrees C at c. ~18.5 cal ka BP followed by rapid warming to near Holocene values immediately after the LGM. The inferred timing, magnitude and trend of maximum cooling and warming display strong similarities to marine records from areas affected by the East Australian current (EAC). The warming trend started at c. ~18.1 cal ka BP and is consistent with the start of deglaciation from Antarctic records. Near Holocene values are maintained through the deglaciation to 15.5 cal ka BP.

Chappell:2006yangtse,"Estimates of regional erosion and sediment mixing from different sources in the Yangtse River system are presented, based on sand samples collected from major tributaries and the trunk stream, at 23 sites between western Sichuan and the Yangtse Delta. Mixing is estimated from concentrations of Mg, Ca, Sr, Ti, Mn and Fe, which are substantially higher in sand from major tributaries in the western Yangtse River catchment than from tributaries in the eastern catchment. Intermediate concentrations occur in sand from the Yangtse Delta, both for modern samples from the surface and for early Holocene samples from drill holes. Mixing ratios indicate that 35 ± 5\% of sand in the delta came from eastern sources. A similar result was obtained using cosmogenic 10Be in quartz grains as a tracer of mixing. Regional erosion rate estimated from 10Be in sand grains from high mountain catchments of the western Yangtse River are mostly similar to rates based on sediment gauging but are sometimes higher, and range to over 700 m Ma− 1, while 10Be measured at upper Yangtse River tributaries on the northeast Tibetan plateau gave rates of 20–30 m Ma− 1. For the eastern catchments, 10Be measurements from quartz sand and sediment gauging both gave rates of 30–70 m Ma− 1. Eroding at this rate, the eastern catchments could not supply more than 20\% of the sediment in the delta, in contrast with 35\% estimated from geochemical fingerprints. The relative input from eastern sources may have been higher in Late Pleistocene times, under a different climatic regime, and reworking of Pleistocene deposits may still be in progress.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Charreau:2017tianshan,"The modern high topography of the Tianshan resulted from the reactivation of a Paleozoic orogenic belt by the India/Asia collision. Today, the range exhibits tectonically active forelands and intermontane basins. Based on quantitative morphotectonic observations and age constraints derived from cosmogenic 10Be dating, single-grain post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (p-IR IRSL) dating and modeling of fault scarp degradation, we quantify the deformation in the Nalati and Bayanbulak intermontane basins in the central Eastern Tianshan. Our results indicate that at least 1.4 mm/yr of horizontal crustal shortening is accommodated within these two basins. This shortening represents over 15\% of the 8.5 ± 0.5 mm/yr total shortening rate across the entire range at this longitude. This shortening rate implies that the Eastern Central Tianshan is thickening at a mean rate of ∼1.4 mm/yr, a rate that is significantly higher than the average denudation rate of 0.14 mm/yr derived from our cosmogenic analysis. This discrepancy suggests that the Tianshan range has not yet reached a steady-state topography and remains in a transient state of topographic growth, most likely due to limited denudation rates driven by the arid climate of Central Asia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Chase:2018seweweeksspoort,"Africa's southern Cape is a key region for the evolution of our species, with early symbolic systems, marine faunal exploitation, and episodic production of microlithic stone tools taken as evidence for the appearance of distinctively complex human behavior. However, the temporally discontinuous nature of this evidence precludes ready assumptions of intrinsic adaptive benefit, and has encouraged diverse explanations for the occurrence of these behaviors, in terms of regional demographic, social and ecological conditions. Here, we present a new high-resolution multi-proxy record of environmental change that indicates that faunal exploitation patterns and lithic technologies track climatic variation across the last 22,300 years in the southern Cape. Conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation were humid, and zooarchaeological data indicate high foraging returns. By contrast, the Holocene is characterized by much drier conditions and a degraded resource base. Critically, we demonstrate that systems for technological delivery – or provisioning – were responsive to changing humidity and environmental productivity. However, in contrast to prevailing models, bladelet-rich microlithic technologies were deployed under conditions of high foraging returns and abandoned in response to increased aridity and less productive subsistence environments. This suggests that posited links between microlithic technologies and subsistence risk are not universal, and the behavioral sophistication of human populations is reflected in their adaptive flexibility rather than in the use of specific technological systems.",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,2022-10-04 19:50:12.484 +0200

Cheetham:2010resolving,"A previous assessment of radiocarbon (14C) dates from alluvial units in southeastern Australia revealed a gap in the geochronological record that coincides with the Holocene climatic optimum. This gap in the alluvial record can be further refined using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The chronology of Holocene river terraces on Widden Brook, a sandy alluvial stream in southeastern Australia, was established using 14C and OSL techniques. Combined use of these independent techniques allows for a more rigorous assessment of the alluvial record. The robust chronology, consisting of 38 14C and 11 OSL samples, permitted identification of significant depositional variation within the catchment, resulting from localised geomorphic processes. The three terrace sequences identified yielded distinct chronologies, suggesting alluvial deposition at different times. The sequences exhibited a continuous chronology, which indicated continuous deposition throughout the Holocene. The chronology of terrace sequences within this catchment suggests that terrace formation can be attributed to localised geomorphic processes rather than climatic forcing.

Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence ages indicated that each terrace sequence was formed during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene (16.7-0.5 ka cal BP).

Chen:1995napperby,"An episode of high lake levels prior to the last maximum glaciation has been identified at many localities in wastern Australia. Similar events have been recognized at playa lakes in central Australia, where gypsum dunes along playa margins formed during one or more episodes of high groundwater discharge, with a large influx of calcium sulphate. At Lake Lewis, exposures at two islands show similar sediment sequences: three pedogenic gypcrete layers interbedded with aeolian quartz and gypsum sand horizons form three units within gypsum dunes up to 7 m high. The lowest unit has cliffed edges buried by the upper units, indicating a significant time break. Four TL dates (coarse-grained quartz) show that this lowest unit was deposited at or before 70-80 ka. The middle unit of mixed gypsum and quartz sand capped by gypcrete represents the major phase of gypsum dune formation, and 6 TL dates range from 33 to 46 ka with overlapping error bars. These are slightly younger but statistically similar to TL dates (from 39 to 59 ka) of the shoreline gypsum dune at Lake Amadeus in the same region. The top unit of the two islands, up to 1 m thick, has not yet been well dated. One date is inconsistent with the well dated middle layer below, possibly because of incomplete bleaching, and has been rejected. The other date (17 ± 5 ka) is much younger which possibly indicates a minor and local reactivation of old gypsum sediments. At the lake margin, there are quartz dunes overlying the gypsum dunes, and a buried aeolian quartz sand layer occurs in a lake-margin terrace. These represent reactivation of the regional quartz dune field after the major gypsum dune formation. Two consistent TL dates (21 ± 4 ka and 23 ± 6 ka) indicate that regional dunes were active at about the time of the Last Glacial Maximum.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Chen:2002murrumbidgee,"In southeastern Australia, aeolian dust deposits are very common and have a significant influence on soil properties and soil landscapes. However, the characteristics of the pure dust materials and the rates of dust-fall in the past are unclear because of the low overall rate of dust deposition and mixing with locally derived sediments. In the Wagga Wagga region, some dunes have functioned as dust traps. Thin (<1 cm thick) red clayey bands and thick (up to 2.5 m) red clayey layers within the dune sequences are likely to represent illuviated aeolian dust. These dust materials are characterised by a bi-modal particle size distribution, one mode in the clay and another in the coarse-medium silt. The clay minerals are dominated by kaolinite, illite and smectite. Both 14C and optical dating indicate the most recent period of dune formation was around 3-4 ka. In an example of these young dunes, there is a total of 2 cm equivalent thickness of dust materials, giving a deposition rate of 0.5-0.7 cm ka-1. All three samples from an elevated dune are saturated with respect to environmental radiation dosage, and give minimum optical ages in excess of 80 ka. In this higher dune, the total thickness of dust is 50-80 cm, similar to that (50-100 cm) of the Yarabee Parna, the youngest aeolian dust deposit in the Wagga Wagga region. This may have been deposited unevenly, being more concentrated during the period 25-16 ka, which has been identified as a major dust deposition period in the Tasman Sea. If this variation occurred, the dust deposition rate indicated by the 50-80 cm dust material in the dune could have been as high as 5 cm ka-1 for the period 25-16 ka.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Chester:2004hawke,"Hawke's Bay is a region of New Zealand where earliest settlement of indigenous people may have occurred. A sedimentological and palynological study of lake sediments from a small catchment was undertaken to reconstruct erosion, vegetation, and fire histories to determine human environmental impact, and thus add to knowledge of the timing of initial settlement of New Zealand. Precise dating was an essential facet of the research because of the short time span of human occupation in New Zealand. A chronology is proposed based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of palynomorph concentrates. Known-age tephras were used as a check on the validity of the 14C ages obtained using this technique, which is being developed at Rafter Radiocarbon Laboratory. Two episodes of sustained erosion occurred between about 1500 and 1050 BC with a period of ~50 yr at about 1300 BC when no erosion occurred. Five episodes of erosion of very short duration occurred at about 625 BC, 450 BC, 100 BC, AD 950, and AD 1400. Erosion probably resulted from landslides induced by earthquakes or severe storms, with the exception of the last event which coincides with local burning and is probably a consequence of this. A conifer/broadleaved forest surrounded the lake until soon after AD 1075--1300, when a dramatic decline in pollen of forest plants and an increase in charcoal occurred. Forest was replaced by fire-induced scrub, interpreted as a result of anthropogenic burning by prehistoric Polynesians.

The north‐western facing Diemtigen flank represents such a dip slope situation and is characterized by a gentle topography, low hillslope gradients, poorly dissected channels, and it hosts large landslides. In contrast, the south‐eastern facing Frutigen side can be described as non‐dip slope flank with deeply incised bedrock channels, high mean hillslope gradients and high relief topography.

The longest core (approx. 15 m) spans the past 130 ka and includes a record of sea-level/lake-level changes, with particular complexity between 80 and 40 ka when sea-level repeatedly breached and withdrew from Gulf/Lake Carpentaria. Evidence from biotic remains (foraminifers, ostracods, pollen), sedimentology and geochemistry clearly identifies a final marine transgression at about 9.7 ka (radiocarbon years).

His MA thesis, ‘Banff Prehistory: prehistoric subsistence and settlement in Banff National Park, Alberta‘, is evidence of an early interest in economically and ecologically oriented archaeology, which he furthered by taking courses and laboratory work in pollen analysis. A visit to South America in 1970 with an archaeological team investigating early farming settlements in the Cauca Valley, Colombia, combined with a long standing interest in Polynesian anthropology to encourage him to seek to do graduate work on tropical agricultural systems somewhere in the Pacific. When he subsequently applied for the ANU scholarship which he took up in early 1972, he seemed a highly suitable person to work in association with the Department of Prehistory‘s project into New Guinea Highlands‘ agricultural history then about to start at Kuk in the upper Wahgi valley (see Mankind, 3:177–83).",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Clapp:2000exceeds,"We use 10Be and 26Al to determine long-term sediment generation rates, identify significant sediment sources, and test for landscape steady state in Nahal Yael, an extensively studied, hyperarid drainage basin in southern Israel. Comparing a 33 yr sediment budget with 33 paired 10Be and 26Al analyses indicates that short-term sediment yield (113 138 t · km-2 · yr-1) exceeds long-term sediment production (74 ± 16 t · km-2 · yr-1) by 53\% 86\%. The difference suggests that the basin is not in steady state, but is currently evacuating sediment accumulated during periods of more rapid sediment generation and lower sediment yield. Nuclide data indicate that (1) sediment leaving the basin is derived primarily from hillslope colluvium, (2) bedrock weathers more rapidly beneath a cover of colluvium than when exposed, and (3) long-term erosion rates of granite, schist, and amphibolite are similar.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Clapp:2001arroyos,"Using 10Be and 26Al measured in sediment and bedrock, we quantify rates of upland erosion and sediment supply to a small basin in northwestern New Mexico. This and many other similar basins in the southwestern United States have been affected by cycles of arroyo incision and backfilling several times in the past few millennia. The sediment generation (275 ± 65 g m−2 yr−1) and bedrock equivalent lowering rates (102 ± 24 m myr−1) we determine are sufficient to support at least three arroyo cycles in the past 3,000 years, consistent with rates calculated from a physical sediment budget within the basin and regional rates determined using other techniques. Nuclide concentrations measured in different sediment sources and reservoirs suggest that the arroyo is a good spatial and temporal integrator of sediment and associated nuclide concentrations from throughout the basin, that the basin is in steady-state, and that nuclide concentration is independent of sediment grain size. Differences between nuclide concentrations measured in sediment sources and reservoirs reflect sediment residence times and indicate that subcolluvial bedrock weathering on hillslopes supplies more sediment to the basin than erosion of exposed bedrock.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In a small (∼8 km2), upland sub-basin, differences in nuclide concentrations between bedrock outcrops and hillslope colluvium suggest weathering of bedrock beneath a colluvial cover is a more significant source of sediment (40×104 kg year−1) than weathering of exposed bedrock surfaces (10×104 kg year−1). Mixing models constructed from nuclide concentrations of sediment reservoirs identify important sediment source areas. Hillslope colluvium is the dominant sediment source to the upper reaches of the sub-basin channel; channel cutting of alluvial terraces is the dominant source in the lower reaches. Similarities in nuclide concentrations of various sediment reservoirs indicate short sediment storage times (<103 years). ...

Clapuyt:2019alpine,"Tectonic and geomorphic processes drive landscape evolution over different spatial and temporal scales. In mountainous environments, river incision sets the pace of landscape evolution, and hillslopes respond to channel incision by, e.g., gully retreat, bank erosion, and landslides. Sediment produced during stochastic landslide events leads to mobilization of soil and regolith on the slopes that can later be transported by gravity and water to the river network during phases of hillslope–channel geomorphic coupling. The mechanisms and scales of sediment connectivity mitigate the propagation of sediment pulses throughout the landscape and eventually drive the contribution of landslides to the overall sediment budget of mountainous catchments. However, to constrain the timing of the sediment cascade, the inherent stochastic nature of sediment and transport through landsliding requires an integrated approach accounting for different space scales and timescales. In this paper, we examine the sediment production on hillslopes and evacuation to the river network of one landslide, i.e. the Schimbrig earthflow, affecting the Entle River catchment located in the foothills of the Central Swiss Alps. We quantified sediment fluxes over annual, decadal, and millennial timescales using respectively unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)–structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques, classic photogrammetry, and in situ produced cosmogenic radionuclides. At the decadal scale, sediment fluxes quantified for the period 1962–1998 are highly variable and are not directly linked to the intensity of sediment redistribution on the hillslope. ...

Clark:1983pollen,"Fires have been part of the Australian environment for a very long time. Fusains, believed to be ancient charcoal, are found in coals dating from about ten million to two hundred and fifty million years ago (Kemp 1981). Adaptations to fire are so prevalent in the most widespread and abundant of Australia's endemic plant genera (Gill 1975, 1981a), that it is thought they must have evolved with fre- quent fires. This is not the only possibility, as many of these adaptations also enhance survival through other stresses such as drought, frost, disease and defoliation (Gill 1975). In pre-human times lightning would have been the most common ignition source, with volcanic eruptions and spontaneous combustion of coal and peat being locally important at times.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Clark:1983thesis,"Several approaches are taken to the problems of reconstructing fire history from charcoal preserved in lake and swamp sediments and analysed along with pollen. The differing effects on charcoal of sample preparation techniques are investigated and the usual pollen preparation procedure is recommended for concentrating charcoal. A simple and rapid method of quantifying charcoal in pollen preparations by point count estimation of projected area is introduced and it is shown how the method can also be applied to thin sections of sediments to estimate the annual input volume of charcoal. The production and transport of charcoal are discussed and it is argued that models of charcoal transport are not useful for deducing the locations of fires from charcoal assemblages in sediments. Experiments are described in which the amount of charcoal produced by and transported from present-day fires is estimated. It is found that most charcoal remains in a burned area and more is removed in suspension in water than is carried away in smoke. Thus, most charcoal in a sedimentary basin comes from its water catchment and areas close to, but outside, its catchment. The charcoal catchment is unlikely to be the same as the pollen catchment. The sedimentary charcoal record is of fire-rainfall events, not of fires alone. Deposition of charcoal in sediments is discussed and it is shown that either more or less frequent fires may increase the amount of charcoal deposited over a given time, depending mainly on the rate of fuel accumulation. A model is devised to show how the relationship between true and apparent fire histories may be affected by the sediment sampling scheme. Examples are provided of the use of pollen and charcoal to reconstruct vegetation and fire histories of three sites in South Australia. At one site, the amount of charcoal in sediments appears better related to the history of deposition and preservation than to that of fires. Comparison of the amount of charcoal in sediments from sites in Australia and New Guinea demonstrates that similar or different fire regimes may be identified at sites with comparable vegetation and catchments, and that the impact on vegetation of people using fire might be clearly distinguishable only in areas where natural fires were previously absent or rare. Expressing charcoal quantities as amount per unit dry weight of inorganic sediment is shown to be more informative than as amount per unit volume of wet sediment. Size distributions of charcoal particles are considered, but do not appear to be useful for interpretation. The difficulties of discerning past effects of Aboriginal burning on the vegetation of Australia are discussed and assumptions about Aboriginal use of fire and its effects are questioned. It is concluded that Aborigines neither created nor maintained large areas of grassland and that climate has been more important than fire in determining vegetation distribution. The sedimentary charcoal record of fire history is an imperfect one, but its interpretation, based on an awareness of the complexities of the processes involved, is the best means available for studying the long-term effects of fire regimes on vegetation.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Clark:2011edgar,Geomorphic mapping of the ~30 km Lake Edgar fault scarp in SW Tasmania suggests that three large surface-rupturing events with vertical displacements of 2.4 -3.1 m have occurred in late Quaternary times. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology from a sequence of three periglacial fluvial terraces associated with scarp incision provides constraint on the age of these events. The ages of alluvial/colluvial fans derived from the youngest fluvial terraces constrain the most recent event to ca 17 -18 ka. The chronology of the two preceding events is more poorly constrained. The near coincidence of ages from the base of the youngest terrace and the penultimate terrace suggest that penultimate faulting might have occurred during active fluvial deposition ca 25 -28 ka. The oldest recognised event occurred subsequent to the ca 61 ka deposition of gravels on the highest of the three terraces and prior to the deposition of ca 48 ka gravels exposed in the footwall fan ...

Clarke:1994phd,"This thesis presents an archaeological study of contact where an island Aboriginal society in northern Australia experienced first contact with non­ Aboriginal cultural groups in the recent past. The island society is that of the Anindilyakwa-speaking clans of the Groote Eylandt archipelago in the Northern Territory of Australia. The research is based on eleven months of fieldwork conducted on Groote Eylandt over three periods in 1990, 1991 and 1992 and reports on the results of test-excavations carried out at 18 different archaeological sites. I put forward the thesis that changes in resource use and residence patterns can be identified in the archaeological record during the period of Macassan contact, and that there is a trajectory of change leading into the last seventy years of Mission settlement. I present a three part model of resource use and residence patterns encompassing the pre-contact period, Macassan contact and the period of Mission settlement. I further suggest that the changes identified in the archaeological record are indicative of a re-structuring of the cultural landscape as result of contact, first with Macassans and later with missionaries. The analyses of archaeological, ethnographic and archival information presented in this thesis suggest that the influence of Macassan contact on Aboriginal culture was more far reaching than has previously been considered. In this thesis the relationship between Aboriginal society of Groote Eylandt and outsiders is analysed as a process of interaction and mediation. The concept of mediation provides for an active and negotiated relationship between Macassans and Aboriginal people, and Europeans and Aboriginal people. ...

Clarke:2006isoleucine,"The epimerization of the amino acid isoleucine in avian eggshells has been used to determine the timing of a variety of events throughout the Late Quaternary. Epimerization is a chemical reaction that interconverts L-isoleucine into its epimer D-alloisoleucine. Geochronological investigations based on isoleucine epimerization in avian eggshells have been used to help assess the timing of the extinction of a member of the Australian megafauna, Genyornis, a large flightless bird (Miller et al. 1999a). Isoleucine epimerization in Genyornis and water bird eggshells have been used to confine the timing of lacustrine episodes beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating in central Australia (Magee and Miller 1998). Ages derived from isoleucine epimerization in Struthio eggshells in African archaeological sites have been important in refining the chronology for the evolution of modern humans (Brooks et al. 1990; Miller et al. 1999b). Recently, the extent of isoleucine epimerization in Casuarius eggshells was used to support a radiocarbon chronology attesting to a Pleistocene antiquity for the occupation of Papuan rainforest (Pasveer et al. 2002).",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,
Clarke:2007eggshells,"Our research demonstrates that the extent of isoleucine epimerisation (A/I) in fragments of avian eggshells provides geochronological information in archaeological contexts. In the archaeological sequence of Hay Cave, northern Queensland, Australia, there is an excellent correspondence between the A/I values of Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami) eggshells (n = 99) and independent geochronological control (n = 16 radiocarbon ages including 4 on eggshell calcite). The A/I values identify three phases of deposition during the Holocene at Hay Cave. In contrast to the Alectura eggshell A/I values, a poor correspondence was observed between the A/I values of cassowary (Casuarius) eggshells from Toé (n = 35) and Kria caves (n = 23) (Ayamaru Plateau, Papua) and the depths from which the specimens were recovered in these stratified sequences. Given coherent archaeofauna trends and radiocarbon chronologies (n = 8 and 2 eggshell calcite radiocarbon ages at Toé and Kria, respectively) with respect to depth, the variable A/I values are not explicable in terms of mixing. Rather, the variability is most likely due to exposure of the eggshells to the high temperatures of campfires. Despite the variability, eggshells with relatively low A/I values amongst specimens recovered from similar depths (and therefore presumably least influenced by high temperatures) exhibit a gradual increase in A/I with respect to depth, as expected in a stratified deposit. From this observation it is suggested that the identification of heated eggshells will increase confidence in geochronological information provided by A/I. These studies illustrate the complications that arise from campfire-induced acceleration of amino acid racemisation and emphasise that although this phenomenon is common, it is not universally encountered in archaeological contexts.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The site also contains one of the largest stone artefact assemblages in Sahul for this early period. However, the stone artefacts and other important archaeological components of the site have never been described in detail, leading to persistent doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. We report on our analysis of the stone artefacts and faunal and other materials recovered during the 1989 excavations, as well as the stratigraphy and depositional history recorded by the original excavators. We demonstrate that the technology and raw materials of the early assemblage are distinctive from those in the overlying layers. Silcrete and quartzite artefacts are common in the early assemblage, which also includes edge-ground axe fragments and ground haematite. The lower flaked stone assemblage is distinctive, comprising a mix of long convergent flakes, some radial flakes with faceted platforms, and many small thin silcrete flakes that we interpret as thinning flakes. Residue and use-wear analysis indicate occasional grinding of haematite and woodworking, as well as frequent abrading of platform edges on thinning flakes. We conclude that previous claims of extensive displacement of artefacts and post-depositional disturbance may have been overstated. The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50-60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods.

In some cases, the earliest of these middens and shell mounds formed on top of older middens from which Anadara granosa is totally absent, and in which Terebralia spp. (while occurring in relatively low concentrations) is the dominant shell species. Anadara granosa dominated middens (sensu lato) occur in a variety of forms across the landscape, including large shell mounds, earth mounds (or mounded shell middens), lenses of shell eroding out of well-developed dunes, and undifferentiated surface shell scatters. The large number of middens which occur throughout the region from the mid Holocene, and the volume of shell represented by these sites, point to the occurrence of significant economic and social changes from the mid to late Holocene. The Abydos Coastal Plain experienced increasing aridity, and, as a result, increased resource stress during the mid-Holocene. We suggest that the large, single species Anadara granosa middens were occupied during regular periods when large groups of Aboriginal people undertook ceremonial activities after the wet season, when resources were abundant. Changes apparent in the archaeological record, including the occurrence of large numbers of Anadara granosa dominated middens and shell mounds, increased establishment of archaeological sites and increased complexity and distance of exchange systems, came about as a result of social, economic and logistical restructuring.

We combined these catchment-averaged erosion rates, and the mean slope values with which they are associated, in a digital elevation model (DEM)–based analysis to predict distributions of cosmogenic 21Ne concentrations in the sediment leaving the Gaub catchment. We compared these synthetic distributions with the distribution of concentrations of cosmogenic 21Ne (21NeC) in 32 quartz fluvial pebbles (16–21 mm) collected from the catchment outlet. The 21NeC concentrations span nearly two orders of magnitude (2.6–160 × 106 atoms/g) and are highly skewed toward low values. The DEM-based analysis confirms this skew—the measured 21NeC distribution plots within the envelope of distributions predicted for the catchment.

The inconsistency between the 10Be and 26Al in the pebbles and the 10Be in the amalgamated sand is likely due to the combined effect of differential sediment sourcing and longer sediment transport times for the pebbles compared to the sand-sized grains. ...

Cohen:2008disjunct,"The Bellinger River catchment in the New England Fold Belt on the mid-north coast of New South Wales is characterized by an assemblage of stepped late Quaternary alluvial units. Late Pleistocene terraces were formed by large, more competent rivers that eroded almost entire valley floors; however, a decline in discharge prior to the Holocene has resulted in the abandonment of these deposits as elevated terraces or residual alluvium, onlapped by contemporary floodplains. Intrinsic controls on floodplain formation appear to be superimposed over an early-mid-Holocene climatic signature. A fluvially active period, known as the Nambucca Phase, from 10 to 4.5 ka, eroded Late Pleistocene terraces. Two floodplain surfaces, one higher than the other, both started to accrete vertically from 4 ka but with some valley locations remaining vulnerable to episodes of erosion, resulting in substantial units of even younger basal alluvium. The high floodplain is dominated by horizontally laminated, vertically accreted sequences, while the low floodplain, which overlaps in age, is characterized by pronounced cut-and-fill stratigraphy. Terraces and floodplains in partly confined settings can have similar elevations but be polycyclic, with very different basal ages. In such landscapes the classical assumption that individual terrace or floodplain profiles along a valley represent periods of coeval formation is shown to be frequently invalid.

Cohen:2010cooper,"The Innamincka Dome and associated low-gradient fan in the Strzelecki Desert is the product of Cenozoic crustal warping that has aided formation of an extensive array of palaeochannels, source-bordering transverse dunes and superimposed linear dunes. These dunes have impeded the course of Cooper Creek and provided a repository of evidence for Quaternary climate change as well as the interactive processes between transverse and linear dune formation. At Turra, Gidgealpa and sites nearby are extensive fluvial and aeolian sand bodies that date from marine isotope stages (MIS) 8–3 and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and are now surrounded or buried by overbank mud. The sandy alluvium was deposited on the downstream slope of the dome by large channels transporting abundant bedload, subsequently blown northward to form transverse dunes from what were probably seasonally-exposed bars in a palaeo-Cooper system. Thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages demonstrate that the base of the dune complex is at least MIS 7 in age (∼250ka) but that it has been subsequently reworked by wind with additional sand blown from the river. Source-bordering dunes formed during a period of enhanced river flow and sand supply from ∼120 to 100ka, with another short episode of the same at ∼85–80ka and from ∼68 to 53. The LGM was associated with enhanced flows and the supply of dune sediment, from 28 to 18ka. Pronounced river flow and dune activity occurred in the early to mid Holocene, but there is no evidence of dunes being supplied from Cooper Creek since the LGM. The dunes forming the oldest basal sand units appear to be largely transverse in form and are aligned roughly parallel to adjacent east–west trending palaeochannels. Linear dunes have formed from and over these, and yield basal ages ranging from MIS 5 or MIS 4 but continuing to accrete and rework through to the Holocene. The study results in one of the few detailed chronological investigations of the interaction between transverse and linear dunes. It is apparent that long-distance sand transport has played no significant role in dune formation here for the linear dunes show no significant downwind decline in ages. Linear dunes appear to have accreted vertically from underlying transverse dunes. A wind-rift vertical accretion model with only minor lengthwise extension is the dominant mode of linear dune formation in this section of the Strzelecki Desert, the bulk of dune sediment being sourced from adjacent swales since the LGM.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Cohen:2011megalakes,"The nature of the Australian climate at about the time of rapid megafaunal extinctions and humans arriving in Australia is poorly understood and is an important element in the contentious debate as to whether humans or climate caused the extinctions. Here we present a new paleoshoreline chronology that extends over the past 100 k.y. for Lake Mega-Frome, the coalescence of Lakes Frome, Blanche, Callabonna and Gregory, in the southern latitudes of central Australia. We show that Lake Mega-Frome was connected for the last time to adjacent Lake Eyre at 50-47 ka, forming the largest remaining interconnected system of paleolakes on the Australian continent. The final disconnection and a progressive drop in the level of Lake Mega-Frome represents a major climate shift to aridification that coincided with the arrival of humans and the demise of the megafauna. The supply of moisture to the Australian continent at various times in the Quaternary has commonly been ascribed to an enhanced monsoon. This study, in combination with other paleoclimate data, provides reliable evidence for periods of enhanced tropical and enhanced Southern Ocean sources of water filling these lakes at different times during the last full glacial cycle.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Additional lacustrine, palynological and terrestrial proxies are used to reconstruct a record that extends back to 105ka, confirming that Lakes Mega-Frome and Mega-Eyre were joined to create the largest system of palaeolakes on the Australian continent as recently as 50-47ka. The palaeohydrological record indicates a progressive shift to more arid conditions, with marked drying after 45ka. Subsequently, Lake Mega-Frome has filled independently at 33-31ka and at the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum to volumes some 40 times those of today. Further sequentially declining filling episodes (to volumes 25-10 those of today) occurred immediately prior to the Younger Dryas stadial, in the mid Holocene and during the medieval climatic anomaly. Southern hemisphere summer insolation maxima are a poor predictor of palaeolake-filling episodes. An examination of multiple active moisture sources suggests that palaeolake phases were driven independently of insolation and at times by some combination of enhanced Southern Ocean circulation and strengthened tropical moisture sources.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

During this pluvial interval Lake Callabonna filled to 10-12 times the volume of the largest historical filling (1974) and reached maximum depths of 4-5~m, compared to the 0.5-1.0~m achieved today. Until now there has been no direct evidence for the MCA in the arid interior of Australia. A multi-proxy, analogue-based atmospheric circulation reconstruction indicates that the pluvial episode was associated with an anomalous meridional atmospheric circulation pattern over the Southern extratropics, with high sea-level pressure ridges in the central Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea, and a trough extending from the Southern Ocean into central Australia. A major decline in the mobility of the Australian aboriginal hunter-gatherer coincides with this MCA period, in southern central Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Cohen:2015transformation,"Central to the debate over the extinction of many of Australia's last surviving megafauna is the question: Was climate changing significantly when humans arrived and megafauna went extinct? Here we present a new perspective on variations in climate and water resources over the last glacial cycle in arid Australia based on the study of the continent's largest lake basin and its tributaries. By dating paleoshorelines and river deposits in the Lake Eyre basin, we show that major hydrological change caused previously overflowing megalakes to enter a final and catastrophic drying phase at 48 ± 2 ka just as the giant bird, Genyornis newtoni, went extinct (50-45 ka). The disappearance of Genyornis and other megafauna has been previously attributed to 'ecosystem collapse' coincident with the spread of fire-wielding humans. Our findings suggest a climate-driven hydrological transformation in the critical window of human arrival and megafaunal extinction, and the results call for a re-evaluation of a human-mediated cause for such extinctions in arid Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Coleman:2002cooper,"Cooper Creek at Innamincka in South Australia is one of very few places where evidence of palaeoclimatic history from the Quaternary Period is preserved in at least three stratigraphic settings; fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine. The significance of this study location is enhanced firstly because here this semi-arid to arid partly tropical catchment has a drainage area of nearly 237 000 km2 and therefore constitutes a very significant portion of the 1.3 million km2 Lake Eyre basin, Australia's largest dryland drainage system. Secondly, and very unusually for such a large river system, the flow of the Cooper at Innamincka bifurcates; north to Coongie Lakes, west towards Lake Eyre, and south down Strzelecki Creek and into the Lake Frome basin. This study attempts to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental Quaternary history of a complex system of dividing drainage. Sixty nine thermoluminescence dates and numerous stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses, including particle size, mineral content, and petrographic and scanning electron microscopy, reveal interacting depositional conditions in alluvial (channel and overbank), aeolian (source-bordering and longitudinal dune) and lacustrine (lunette) environments, information that provides an improved understanding of Australian Quaternary climatic and flow-regime changes in central Australia. These results point to a progressive but probably oscillating drying trend on Cooper Creek during the Mid to Late Quaternary. The oldest dated alluvium near Innamincka suggests extensive fluvial activity at about 250 ka to 230 ka (OI Stages 7/8), some of it well away from the existing channel. In agreement with work done by others further upstream on Cooper Creek, there appears after this to have been a period of reduced fluvial activity until extensive channels operated again along both Cooper and Strzelecki Creeks during the middle of OI Stage 6. This was followed by another probable hiatus until OI Stage 5 when significant fluvial activity was this time associated with the development of source-bordering dunes adjacent to palaeochannels on Cooper Creek, and with the formation lunettes in the Coongie Lakes region. Pronounced fluvial activity appears to have continued through to OI Stage 4, ceasing at locations other than near the existing channel of Cooper Creek by about 60 ka to 52 ka. While Cooper Creek had sufficient power to continue to slowly migrate in the vicinity of its present channel from about 55 ka until the LGM , the region was clearly significantly drier and less fluvially active from early OI Stage 3 to the present.

Wet sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest occupied the valley throughout the post glacial and attained its maximum development between 11.7 and 8.4 ka BP. Rainforest never occupied the valley floor extensively. Phyllocladus aspleniifolius sattained an early maximum about 13 ka BP.

Wet montane forest and heath then developed with Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, Nothofagus cunninghamii and Eucalyptus until c. 10,000 BP. After 10,000 BP a mosaic of N. cunninghamii rainforest, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae scrub and Sprengelia incarnata heath occurred. The development of the vegetation from alpine communities to temperate rainforest, which is near its limit at 600 m, occurred under the influence of improving climatic conditions with rapid upslope migration or local expansion of taxa during the late glacial. Temperatures were warm enough for the development of rainforest at 600 m by 10,000 BP, if not earlier. The development of a mosaic of rainforest, scrub and heath vegetation rather than extensive rainforest after 10,000 BP reflects the influence of poor soils, bad drainage and fires. Comparison with similar pollen diagrams from western Tasmania suggests that the development of pollen/vegetation associations was time transgressive with altitude during the late glacial when climatic influences and migration rates were important, and that the mosaic of vegetation communities became more complex during the Holocene because of adjustment to or control by local ecological factors.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

The denudation rates upstream and downstream of the Halikan anticline are consistent with the GPS convergence rates in these areas. The sharp increase in denudation rates over the Halikan anticline denotes its growth as previously detected from terrace incision. It also reveals small wavelength coupling between crustal deformation and erosion.

Connelly:2020holocene,"The archaeological record of the Hamersley Plateau in northwestern Australia records over 45 ka of Aboriginal occupation though some of the most significant climatic events experienced by people on this continent, including the highly variable conditions of the Holocene (0-10 ka). The mid-to-late Holocene was a period of highly variable climatic conditions that impacted the availability and predictability of subsistence resources, increasing foraging risk. It was in these changing conditions that Aboriginal people practiced increased economising behaviour in the production of stone tools to reduce the cost of replacing them and to ensure they were functional under unpredictable conditions. Hiscock‘s (2006) extendibility continuum and provisioning strategies were used as a framework to identify the timing and magnitude of economising behaviour in the eastern Hamersley Plateau. Using lithic assemblages from two stratified rockshelters, Orebody XXIX and PAD 10-14, this research investigates changes in the production and reduction of stone artefacts during the Holocene. Quantitative attributes of artefacts demonstrate distinct patterns correlating to Hiscock‘s (2006) provisioning strategies, identifying increased use of abundance and extension provisioning strategies during the last 5 ka of the Holocene, concurrent with the harshest climatic conditions on the Hamersley Plateau. The abundance strategy - emphasising the production of large numbers of small flakes and backed artefacts suitable to conditions of unpredictable resource availability - peaked during the 2.5-5 ka period, when conditions were most unpredictable. ...

The larger aims of this thesis were to develop a tool for determining fire severity/intensity of past fire regimes and examine the long-term fire history of Lake Couridjah to investigate how and when (and if) people used fire to change the environment as a consequence of changing climatic and environmental conditions. It was also applied to Lake Werri Berri to examine the transition between Aboriginal and European custodianship of the area around the lake and to determine if their markedly different methods of land-use are apparent in the charcoal record. A new method for determining fire severity/intensity in past environments using FTIR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical modelling (Partial Least Squares regression, PLS-R) is introduced in Chapter 2. FTIR spectra were obtained from a reference library of laboratory produced charcoal derived from common Australian species at Charring Intensities (CI, representing the integration of pyrolysis temperature and duration of heat exposure) frequently reached in bushfires. The modelled coefficients from the charcoal library were then used to quantify the CI of charcoal of unknown heating duration (e.g., modern charcoal, fossil sedimentary charcoal). Although the more homogenous reference library of laboratory produced charcoal is not an exact analogue for charcoal produced in a wildfire, it has the potential to offer insights into the severity/intensity of past fire regimes and may offer an inexpensive and easily applicable tool for evaluating recent wildfires. In the course of exploring Charring Intensity on fossil charcoal, it was found that very little charcoal had CI values below ~3.0°C s 106 (~400° C). It was hypothesized that the use of a light oxidant, a common treatment for concentrating sedimentary charcoal, was degrading lightly-pyrolyzed material. To test this hypothesis, a series of charcoal samples was produced in a nitrogen purged tube furnace at 250-800 °C, then the total surface area of 20 replicates of each temperature group was measured before and after 24 hours of immersion in a 4 percent bleach (sodium hypochlorite) solution. It was found that charcoal particles formed ≤400 °C were almost completely degraded in the bleach treatment and particles formed above at ≥400 °C were much more resistant to oxidation. These results suggest that use an oxidant to concentrate charcoal removes material formed at temperatures below ~400 °C from techniques commonly used for the analysis of macrocharcoal, with the result being fire histories might be biased toward high intensity (high temperature) fires. The insights from these studies on FTIR and charcoal methods were then applied to the elucidation of the past fire regime at Thirlmere Lakes. This included consideration of the fire history of Lake Couridjah, a record that spans 135 calibrated kilo anni Before Present (ka BP), and thereby encompassing the present and previous interglacial periods (albeit, with a hiatus between ~18-105 ka BP). Importantly, this record covers two climatically similar glacial-interglacial transitions and interglacials (MIS 6-5 and MIS 2-1) ,but notably one was without, and MIS 2-1 had people present. CHAR during both glacial/interglacial transitions was high and variable, followed by interglacial periods of reduced charcoal influx, suggesting that the transitions were times of high fire activity, likely a consequence of climatic instability and increasing biomass accumulation in the catchment. CI, however, was high but relatively stable throughout MIS 6-5, with higher levels often occurring during periods of low CHAR, suggesting that the influx of charcoal into the lake may in part be attributed to catchment stability reducing sedimentation rather reductions in area burned. CI values were often higher during periods of low CHAR, however, suggesting that periods of increased biomass led to higher intensity fires. In contrast to the relatively high but stable CI of MIS 6-5, the transition into interglacial conditions during MIS 2-1 had highly variable CI values that were much lower (~2°C s 106), suggesting that despite increasing biomass accumulation and a warming climate, the fires were of lower severity/intensity, perhaps the result of human interference in the fire regime. This study suggests that late Pleistocene human populations perhaps attempted to (but ultimately failed) to maintain a more open woodland vegetation structure through selective burning as the ameliorating climate led to increasing productivity in the environment following the glacial termination. At around 10 ka BP, it appears this attempt was abandoned, and CI values suggest that fire severity/intensity increased, and CHAR (area burnt) decreased and remained stable until present, suggestive of a fire regime largely controlled by the stable climate of the Holocene. Five common charcoal analysis methods (4 using an oxidant and one control using H2O) were tested in conjunction with CI and CHAR on a 900-year core (WB3) from Lake Werri Berri. The five treatment groups (4 oxidants and a simple H2O wash as a control) showed very similar peaks in CHAR. However, minimum CI values were significantly lower in the samples treated with H2O, again suggesting that oxidative treatments are preferentially removing lightly-pyrolyzed material. This study considered CI using two combined treatments (H2O and 6 hours in 4 percent bleach), which captured the largest range of Charring Intensity values (2.8-5.4°C s 106) and CHAR through the 6-hour treatment of 4 percent bleach. CI was relatively high and stable throughout the core, with infrequent peaks coinciding with periods of climate fluctuation (~500 BP, late-20th and early 21st century). Interestingly, there was no apparent change in fires (CI or CHAR) during the transition between Aboriginal custodianship and the European occupation of Australia, even after settlement around the Thirlmere Lakes region. It is possible that the people who lived in the area prior to European settlement may not have benefitted from the sustained and systematic application of fire to the environment during the majority of the Holocene, given the resources at hand associated with the freshwater lakes. In contrast, from the latter part of the 20th century, fire frequency and intensity/severity dramatically increased, suggesting that anthropogenic climate change, perhaps in combination with changing land use, caused unprecedented change to the fire regime at Lake Werri Berri, a trend found at a number of other sites in eastern Australia.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Constantine:2023exploration,"Ethnographic observations suggest that Indigenous peoples employed a distinct regime of frequent, low-intensity fires in the Australian landscape in the past. However, the timing of this behaviour and its ecological impact remain uncertain. Here, we present detailed analysis of charcoal, including a novel measure of fire severity using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, at a site in eastern Australia that spans the last two glacial/interglacial transitions between 135--104 ka and 18--0.5 ka BP (broadly equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6-5 and 2-1, respectively). The accumulation of charcoal and vegetation composition was similar across both periods, correlating closely with Antarctic ice core records, and suggesting that climate is the main driver of fire regimes. Fire severity was lower over the past 18,000 years compared to the penultimate glacial/interglacial period and suggests increasing anthropogenic influence over the landscape during this time. Together with local archaeological records, our data therefore imply that Indigenous peoples have been undertaking cultural burning since the beginning of the Holocene, and potentially the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. We highlight the fact that this signal is not easily discernible in the other proxies examined, including widely used charcoal techniques, and propose that any anthropogenic signal will be subtle in the palaeo-environmental record. While early Indigenous people's reasons for landscape burning were different from those today, our findings nonetheless suggest that the current land management directions are based on a substantive history and could result in a reduction in extreme fire events.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Constantine:2023werri,"The drivers of fire regimes prior to the European occupation of Australia are still contentious, with some advocating regimes dominated by anthropogenic ignitions and others advocating a climate source or mixture of these elements. Here, we examine an 850-year history of fire regimes at Lake Werri Berri in south-east Australia, prior to and following European occupation. Macroscopic charcoal and FTIR spectroscopy were used to infer broad changes of the fire regime in proximity to the lake. We found little change through much of the 850-year period and most interesting, no apparent change following the initial displacement of Indigenous peoples and the introduction of farming and woodcutting to the region by Europeans. From the mid-20th Century onwards, there was an increase in both area burnt and fire severity or intensity, likely the result of increased fuel load and connectivity following an extended period of increased precipitation and heavier recreational land usage, which likely led to an increase in anthropogenic ignitions.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Cook:2009record,"A palaeoecological record from Lakes Bolac and Turangmoroke details the changing nature of vegetation patterns, lake levels and climate in the drier part of the Victorian Western Plains over approximately the last 90,000 years. In addition to the routine palynological proxies of pollen, spores and charcoal, a range of non-pollen palynomorphs (remains of algae, fungi, insects and other invertebrates) was analysed and described and provides useful additional information on the ecology of past vegetation communities. A chronology for the record is provided by radiocarbon and refined optical luminescence dating in the upper part of the sequence, and the latter technique is used to provide a timeframe for the period beyond the radiocarbon limit. The record shows that during marine isotope stage (MIS) 5.1 and mid MIS 3 the regional vegetation was composed of open woodland dominated by Allocasuarina luehmannii type with low numbers of Banksia, Eucalyptus and other Myrtaceae under which a diverse understorey developed. During these times Lake Turangmoroke held fresh water of varying depths. The degree of representation of MIS 4 and MIS 3 in the record is uncertain owing to discontinuities resulting from the lake having periodically dried. A change to open grassland-steppe occurred shortly after 47,000 years ago and lake levels fluctuated considerably before the lake became shallow and saline. Open grassland-steppe continued through MIS 2 with almost no trees present while the aquatic flora reflected further lake level declines and increasing salinity. Driest conditions, indicated by deflation of lake sediments during lunette building, occurred between ∼18,000 and ∼11,000 cal yr BP. Open woodland in the early Holocene was dominated by A. verticillata type until partial replacement by Eucalyptus around 7000–8000 14C yr BP when the vegetation cover present at European arrival was established.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Cook:2018gongga,"Erosion and tectonic uplift are widely thought to be coupled through feedbacks involving orographic precipitation, relief development, and crustal weakening. In many orogenic systems, it can be difficult to distinguish whether true feedbacks exist, or whether observed features are a consequence of tectonic forcing. To help elucidate these interactions, we examine Gongga Shan, a 7556 m peak on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau where cosmogenic 10Be basin-wide erosion rates reach >5 mm/yr, defining a region of localized rapid erosion associated with a restraining bend in the left-lateral Xianshuihe Fault. Erosion rates are consistent with topography, thermochronometry, and geodetic data, suggesting a stable pattern of uplift and exhumation over at least the past 2–3 My. Transpression along the Xianshuihe Fault, orographically enhanced precipitation, thermally weakened crust, and substantial local relief all developed independently in the Gongga region and existed there prior to the uplift of Gongga Shan. However, only where all of these conditions are present do the observed topographic and erosional extremes exist, and their relative timing indicates that these conditions are not a consequence of rapid uplift. We conclude that their collocation at 3–4 Ma set into motion a series of feedbacks between erosion and uplift that has resulted in the exceptionally high topography and rapid erosion rates observed today.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

These groups differed significantly from their neighbours in the semi-arid and arid zones who have until recently, provided ethno-archaeological models for explaining past Aboriginal behaviour and the bases for regional archaeology.

Exploitation of toxic varieties of nuts began about 2500 cal year BP, peaking after 1500 cal year BP. This economic development appears crucial to successful human adaptation to rainforests in the area and was pivotal in facilitating the long-term permanent human settlement of the wet tropics. The role of fire, El Ni~o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity and shifting vegetation regimes were important catalysts in providing opportunities for permanent Australian rainforest Aboriginal occupation.

Coutts:1982survey,"This past year has been marked by several new developments. The most important of these was the move to the new premises at Albert Park on 8 October 1979. The new building is a two-storeyed edifice with car parking, laboratory and storage facilities on the ground floor and an administrative area on the first floor. The laboratory has several facilities: geological and photographic laboratories, a drying room, faunal reference storage and a compactus for storing archaeological materials and stationery. The new building was officially opened by the Minister, the Honourable w.v. Houghton, on Friday 14 December, and the occasion was marked with a public lecture delivered by Professor Jack Golson, Department of Prehistory, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University. The acquisition of a mobile laboratory- a specially built caravan - is yet another important development. This facility makes possible a wide range of on-site investigations and conservation work, which hitherto were difficult. The caravan is fully air-conditioned, and is equipped with drying and map cabinets, washing facilities, drawing boards and storage cupboards.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Cowan:1991hope,"On the Hope River segment of the Hope Fault, west of Hanmer Springs, New Zealand, a 36 m dextral offset of a dated river terrace riser indicates an average local late Holocene horizontal slip-rate of 10.5 ± 0.5 m/kyr. A trench excavated across the fault in a nearby swamp revealed five silt layers within a 1.5 m thick column of peat. Radiocarbon dates and plant pollen indicate that the base of the swamp is approximately 700 years old, so peat has accumulated at an average rate of 2.35 ± 0.6 mm/yr. The youngest silt layer was probably derived from a landslide triggered during an M 7--7.3 earthquake in 1888 ad, and the older silt layers are attributed to similar prehistoric (pre-1850 ad) earthquakes. Pollen from the lowest silt shows brief local dominance of lacebark (Hoheria cf. H. lyalli) during a phase of former beech (Nothofagus) forest. Sharp increases in the percentage of matagouri (Discaria toumatou) pollen follow the younger silt layers, which were deposited during a later period of fire-induced shrubland. Both lacebark and matagouri are vigorous colonisers of bared ground, and matagouri presently forms the dominant plant cover on fault scarps and landslides known to have been bared during the 1888 earthquake. We infer that this pattern of plant succession on bared sites has followed repeated surface rupture along this segment of the Hope Fault. The vertical spacing of the silt layers, and our calculated mean peat accumulation rate, indicate a recurrence interval for silt deposition of 81--200 years, and support a model proposing that the 1888 earthquake was a characteristic event for the Hope River segment of the Hope Fault.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Cox:2009madagascar,"The central highlands of Madagascar are characterized by rolling hills thickly mantled with saprolite and cut in many areas by dramatic gullies known as lavakas. This landscape generates sediment to rivers via diffusive downslope movement of colluvium and event‐driven advection of material from active lavakas; these two sediment sources have very different 10Be signatures. Analyzed lavaka sediment has very little 10Be ( atoms 10Be g−1), consistent with deep excavation liberating previously shielded saprolite with little exposure to cosmic rays. Colluvium, in contrast, has greater 10Be concentrations ( atoms 10Be g−1), reflecting long residence times in the near‐surface environment. Comparison of 10Be abundance in hillslope, lavaka, and river sediment samples indicates that lavakas dominate the mass input to rivers (84\% by volume) in spite of the fact that they occupy a small fraction of the land surface area. River terrace sediments that are at least a millennium old have 10Be concentrations indistinguishable from those of modern lavaka‐dominated river sands, from which we infer that lavakas were widespread on the landscape at or before the time that humans colonized the central highlands. Erosion rates derived from cosmogenic 10Be in river sediment average approximately 12 m m.yr.−1, or about 32 t km−2 yr−1, which is three orders of magnitude lower than commonly reported erosion rates for Madagascar.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

However, mid-Pleistocene dasyurid assemblages from cave deposits at Mt Etna, Queensland are more diverse than any previously known from rainforest habitats. New taxa will be described elsewhere, but include three new genera as well as new species of Dasyurus, Antechinus and Phascogale. Comparison of dasyurids from Mt Etna sites that are interpreted as rainforest palaeoenvironments with fossil and extant assemblages indicate that they are at least as diverse as those from modern arid environments. Thus Neogene diversification of dasyurids occurred in both arid and rainforest habitats, but only the former survived continuing aridification.

Croke:1996neales,"The Lake Eyre Basin, Australia's largest internal drainage system, represents a key site in unravelling the complexities of terrestrial climate change. The basin, covering one-sixth of the Australian continent, spans a number of climatic zones, including the tropical monsoon system to the north and the mid-latitude westerly circulation to the south. This study describes four major episodes of Quaternary fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian activity in the Neales River, a western catchment of Lake Eyre. The first phase is represented by coarse-grained fluvial aggradation which dates to at least 170 ka. The depocentre of Lake Eyre is believed to have been located further to the east during this phase. The second episode is a phase of high lake level lacustrine deposition which occurred before 103 ka. The deltaic margin of the lake at this time was approximately 20 km west of the present playa. The third phase was characterised by significant base level lowering and channel incision after 50 ka but before 31 ka. Lake level lowering induced fluvial incision of up to 9 m, scouring several metres into the basal silicified Miocene sediments some time after 50 ka. The final phase was a period of aeolian and ephemeral-fluvial deposition which peaked between 20 ka and 18 ka, coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum. These episodes are compared with chronostratigraphic data from the monsoon dominated catchments of the Cooper and Diamantina Rivers. The nature and record of fluvial and lacustrine deposition are correlated throughout the basin during the penultimate and last interglacial cycles. The late Quaternary record is more ambiguous and further studies are required to elucidate the precise nature of climate change in the basin over the last 30 ka.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Croke:1998neales,"The stratigraphy of the lower Neales River to the west of Lake Eyre, Australia's largest internal drainage system, preserves a detailed record of fluvial, lacustrine and aeolian deposits of early Tertiary to Holocene age. This stratigraphic framework provides a summary of the region's Cainozoic sedimentary units. Three units have been identified: an early Tertiary fluvial unit; a mid-Tertiary lacustrine unit; and a Quaternary unit composed of interbedded fluvial, lacustrine, and aeolian facies. Dramatic changes in depositional styles within, and between, these three major groups of sediments reflect the basin's response to changes in climate and sediment supply. Fluvial facies include perennial multi-channel, single-channel, and ephemeral river sequences. Lacustrine and deltaic facies reflect continuous fine-grained sedimentation during periods of high water-tables. The aeolian facies are evidence of aridity and sediment deflation in the basin. The early Tertiary fluvial unit is the result of Late Palaeocene-Eocene epeirogenic movements. A dramatic shift in facies to the mid-Tertiary lacustrine unit reflects a significant change in the basins climatic controls. Quaternary sediments reflect major changes in fluvial discharge regimes which may reflect major climatic and associated hydrological changes during past interglacial and glacial cycles.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Croke:2011fitzroy,"This study reports the nature and timing of Quaternary fluvial activity in the Fitzroy River basin, which drains a diverse 143,000 km2 area in northeastern Queensland, before discharging into the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The catchment consists of an extensive array of channel and floodplain types that we show have undergone large-scale fluvial adjustment in-channel planform, geometry and sinuosity. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz sediments from fifteen (3–18 m) floodplain cores throughout the basin indicates several discrete phases of active bedload activity: at ∼105–85 ka in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, at ∼50–40 ka (MIS 3), and at ∼30–10 ka (MIS 3/2). The overall timing of late Quaternary fluvial activity correlates well with previous accounts from across Australia with rivers being primarily active during interstadials. Fluvial activity, however, does not appear to have been synchronous throughout the basins major sub-catchments. Fluvial activity throughout MIS 2 (i.e. across the Last Glacial Maximum) in the meandering channels of the Fitzroy correlates well with regional data in tropical northeastern Queensland, and casts new light on the river response to reduced rainfall and vegetation cover suggested by regional palaeoclimate indicators. Moreover, the absence of a strong Holocene signal is at odds with previous accounts from elsewhere throughout Australia. The latitudinal position of the Fitzroy across the Tropic of Capricorn places this catchment at a key location for elucidating the main hydrological drivers of Quaternary fluvial activity in northeastern Australia, and especially for determining tropical moisture sources feeding into the headwaters of Cooper Creek, a major river system of the continental interior.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This study measures 10Be concentrations in river sediments from the Burdekin catchment, one of Australia's largest coastal catchments, to determine long-term (> 10,000 years), time-integrated rates of sediment generation and denudation. A nested-sampling design was used to test for effects of increasing catchment scale on nuclide concentrations with upstream catchment areas ranging from 4 to 130,000 km2. Beryllium-10 concentrations in sediment samples collected from the upstream headwater tributaries and mid-stream locations range from 1.8 to 2.89 × 105 atoms g− 1 and data confirm that nuclide concentrations are well and rapidly mixed downstream. Sediment from the same tributaries consistently yielded 10Be concentrations in the range of their upstream samples. Overall, no decrease in 10Be concentrations can be observed at the range of catchment scales measured here. ... [_truncated_]",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2023-01-11 09:27:24.582 +0100
Croke:2016lockyer,"This paper reconstructs past flooding from a range of settings in Lockyer Creek, a key tributary of the mid-Brisbane River, which experienced extreme flood events in AD 2011 and AD 2013. Optically stimulated luminescence samples (n = 110) were collected from alluvial material preserved in within-channel benches and floodplains. Age distributions from material in the bedrock reaches confirm an event ∼ 300 years ago which stripped the valley alluvium to bedrock. In the unconfined reaches floodplain deposits indicate lateral stability over the past 6000 years. Marked differences in the inundation patterns of the AD 2011 event highlighted changes in downstream channel geometry. The age distribution of alluvium in reaches not inundated during AD 2011 was older, ∼12 000 years, with no preserved evidence of deposition during the past 1000 years. A relatively continuous record of floodplain deposition in reaches which were inundated in AD 2011 identifies a major peak in flood activity also around 300 years ago (∼AD 1730) with five additional peaks occurring at approximately AD 1962, AD 1897, AD 1300, AD 550 and 5400 BC. The main climatic driver of changes in flooding over this timescale is oscillations in El Niño Southern Oscillation and although proxy records are scarce for this region, some correlations with high-resolution records of rainfall variability are apparent.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The glacial period was characterized by a gradual reduction of woodland and tall shrubland cover. Recolonization of the dunefields involved a similar, gradual succession from herbfields and low shrublands to tall shrublands and, finally, woodlands.

Cupper:2006murray,"Playa lakes are important palaeoenvironmental repositories in arid landscapes. As geochemically open and organically poor systems, however, accurate dating of playa sequences is often hampered. This study paired accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from four Murray Basin playa lakes to assess the accuracy of the chronometric techniques in these environments. The OSL dating directed the sampling strategy, which targeted sandier sections of the playa lacustrine sequences. These appear to comprise aeolian-derived fine quartzose sand, ensuring the effective resetting of the luminescence signals prior to deposition. In contrast, the 14C ages were on bulk organic carbon and not targeted. Ages are generally in stratigraphic order and span the middle-late last glacial and Holocene. This accords with models of past groundwater hydrology for the playa basins. Only half of the paired samples are in agreement at 2sigma precision, however, with five of the 14C ages older than their corresponding OSL ages. Low organic contents of playa sediments increases the susceptibility of 14C ages to contamination, with the incorporation of small amounts of dead carbon into the dated samples possibly accounting for the apparent discrepancies. Obtaining valid chronologies from arid settings requires close targeting of dated fractions. The application of independent techniques is essential for scrutinizing the dating results.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

These rates are similar to estimates of sediment yield (0.12–0.44 mm/yr), river incision (0.35 mm/yr), and uplift (0.01–1.0 mm/yr) rates inferred from other methods that integrate landscape process rates since the early Pleistocene. These rates of landscape change are significantly lower than long-term exhumation rates of ~1.2 mm/yr since ca. 4.5 Ma, inferred from thermochronometry. Collectively, these data suggest that hillslope erosion and river incision rates in the northern and cen- tral Apennines have balanced local uplift rates for ~1 My, but that exhumation rates have slowed significantly since emergence of the mountain chain in the Pliocene.

Cyr:2010italy,"Rock uplift rates can be difficult to measure over 103–105 yr time scales. If, however, a landscape approaches steady state, where hillslope erosion and rock uplift rates are steady and locally similar, then it should be possible to quantify rock uplift rates from hillslope erosion rates. Here, we test this prediction by comparing channel steepness index values and 10Be catchment-averaged erosion rates to well-constrained rock uplift rates in two landscapes in Italy. The first field area is the Romagna Apennines, northern Italy, where rock uplift rates are relatively uniform, between 0.2 and 0.5 mm/yr (regional mean 0.40 ± 0.15 [SE] mm/yr), and have been steady since 0.9 Ma. The second area is the region around northeastern Sicily and the southernmost Italian peninsula, where rock uplift rates are higher and exhibit a strong spatial gradient, from ∼0.7 to ∼1.6 mm/yr (regional mean 1.09 ± 0.13 [SE] mm/yr). In both regions, channel steepness indices and 10Be erosion rates vary directly with rock uplift rates. Although there is considerable variability in erosion rates, regionally averaged rates in both the northern (0.46 ± 0.04 [SE] mm/yr) and southern (1.21 ± 0.24 [SE] mm/yr) areas accurately measure rock uplift rates. Although channel steepness indices do not quantify rock uplift rates, they are useful for (1) identifying regional patterns of rock uplift, (2) identifying areas where uplift rates might be expected to be uniform, and (3) informing 10Be sampling strategies. This study demonstrates that, together, channel steepness and hillslope erosion rates can provide a powerful tool for determining rock uplift rates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Cyr:2014distinguishing,"Knickpoints in fluvial channel longitudinal profiles and channel steepness index values derived from digital elevation data can be used to detect tectonic structures and infer spatial patterns of uplift. However, changes in lithologic resistance to channel incision can also influence the morphology of longitudinal profiles. We compare the spatial patterns of both channel steepness index and cosmogenic 10Be-determined erosion rates from four landscapes in Italy, where the geology and tectonics are well constrained, to four theoretical predictions of channel morphologies, which can be interpreted as the result of primarily tectonic or lithologic controls. These data indicate that longitudinal profile forms controlled by unsteady or nonuniform tectonics can be distinguished from those controlled by nonuniform lithologic resistance. In each landscape the distribution of channel steepness index and erosion rates is consistent with model predictions and demonstrates that cosmogenic nuclide methods can be applied to distinguish between these two controlling factors.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Daley:2017formation,"Along the eastern margin of Australia, hydrological variability reaches a peak in the subtropics of south-east Queensland and many rivers have entrenched characteristics. To address the nature of entrenchment and the relationship with adjacent alluvium, this paper presents the results of detailed chrono-stratigraphic analysis of alluvial units in the partly confined mid-reaches of Lockyer Creek, Australia. Four sites were investigated using topographic, sedimentological and chronological data. Radiocarbon and single grain optically stimulated luminescence dating indicate a large proportion of the valley fill reflects a major phase of aggradation of fine-grained alluvium from ca. 35 ka throughout the Last Glacial Cold Period. Synchronous incision of Pleistocene alluvial fills between 11.5 and 9.3 ka suggests the current entrenched Lockyer Creek formed in response to changes in late Quaternary climate. Holocene floodplains set within the entrenched Pleistocene valley floor have basal ages of ca. 7.5 ka, but whose proximal margins are still actively accreting. This Holocene fill has accreted over the mid- to late Holocene but overlaps with the contemporary hydrological regime. The sedimentary nature of the Holocene fill appears to be related to persistent antecedent controls in the form of bedrock and terrace constriction.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Darling:2020resistant,"Prior numerical modeling work has suggested that incision into sub‐horizontal layered stratigraphy with variable erodibility induces non‐uniform erosion rates even if base‐level fall is steady and sustained. Erosion rates of cliff bands formed in the stronger rocks in a stratigraphic sequence can greatly exceed the rate of base‐level fall. Where quartz in downstream sediment is sourced primarily from the stronger, cliff‐forming units, erosion rates estimated from concentrations of cosmogenic beryllium‐10 (10Be) in detrital sediment will reflect the locally high erosion rates in retreating cliff bands. We derive theoretical relationships for threshold hillslopes and channels described by the stream‐power incision model as a quantitative guide to the potential magnitude of this amplification of 10Be‐derived erosion rates above the rate of base‐level fall. Our analyses predict that the degree of erosion rate amplification is a function of bedding dip and either the ratio of rock erodibility in alternating strong and weak layers in the channel network, or the ratio of cliff to intervening‐slope gradient on threshold hillslopes. ...

David:1991fern,"In this paper, evidence is presented to show that there have been significant changes in the distribution of rock art types in northeastern Australia during the mid- to late-Holocene. The observations are made that 1) the more recent art can be divided geographically into two distinct groups, corresponding to two relatively disparate, ethnographically documented trading networks, located to the north and southwest of the Walsh River, and 2) within each of these regions rock paintings are formally extremely regionalised. The earlier art, on the other hand, shows a very different, more homogeneous spatial distribution. The antiquity of these art forms is first established, followed by a brief discussion of the ethnographic literature for clues as to the relationship between material behaviour and social formations during ethnohistoric times. It is concluded that the changes observed in the rock art from the region reflect relatively recent changes in patterns of interaction, including a regionalisation of social formations after 2500 years ago. These changes may express alterations of strategies related to systems of dispute management, which may be directly related to growing populations. The paper concludes with a brief examination of some of the implications of these observations.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

David:1992date,"Until recently, the dating of pre-Historic rock paintings relied exclusively on indirect determinations by their asso­ciation with archaeological materials of known antiquity. Because of the fragility of ancient rock art, it had generally not been possible to extract organic matter from rock paintings because of the large amounts of carbon required for conventional carbon dating techniques. The advances in carbon dating, especially via Accelerator MassSpec­trometry (AMS), which occurred during the 1980s, enabled the dating of very small amounts of carbon. This has afforded archaeologists with new potentials for dating rock art. Such a potential has already been proven by AMS dates obtained from a number of rock art sites around the world (e.g. Lorblanchet et al. 1990; Loy et al. 1990; McDonald et al. 1990; Russ et al. 1990; Watchman 1992).

David:1997cape,"The prehistory of Cape York Peninsula, in tropical northern Australia, has been more intensively investigated than that of most other parts of the continent. As a result, a considerable database now exists by which long-term archaeological trends can be evaluated. In this paper we investigate temporal trends in occupational intensities and patterns of land use during the last 37,000 years by employing: 1, the temporal distribution of all radiocarbon dates obtained for the region; 2, the numbers of sites occupied through time; and 3, rates of establishment of new sites during the course of prehistory. These archaeological trends are then compared with the palaeo-environmental record of the region to determine its potential influence on the trends. We conclude that an initial, long period of regional occupation occurred (c. 37,000–4000 BP) when cultural trends varied in tandem with gross environmental fluctuations. This was followed by a late Holocene period (post 4000 BP) when cultural trajectories diverged significantly from environmental trends. This suggests that more complex Aboriginal demographic processes were set in train during the late Holocene, associated with social structures that were more dynamic than previously. We suggest that while changing patterns of land use may be apparent, their understanding requires an enquiry into periods of emergence — that is, their immediate historical antecedents. These results have broader implications for our understanding of Australian prehistory and the prehistory of other hunter-gatherer societies.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

It represents a rare account of the ceramic assemblage from a short duration village on a relic beach ridge in southern Papua New Guinea, and contributes to ongoing attempts to refine ceramic sequences in the recipient (western) end of the hiri system of long-distance maritime trade. Because of the presence of a single occupational period of a few decades at most, short duration sites such as Keveoki 1 allow for chronological refinement of ceramic conventions in a way that multilevel sites usually cannot, owing to the lack of stratigraphic mixing between chronologically separate ceramic assemblages in the former.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Fifty archaeological excavations were undertaken, revealing a rich history of islet use culminating with the emergence of Koey Ngurtai as a ritual centre after 550-700 cal BP, and a proliferation of ritual structures focused on dugong hunting magic after 350-550 cal BP. Shortly after the arrival of colonial powers in Torres Strait in the 1870s, including pearl shelling and missionary activity, Koey Ngurtai‘s ritual status was again transformed.

David:2010emo,"Since the 1970s the site of Emo (aka ‘Samoa‘, ‘OAC‘) in the Gulf Province of Papua New Guinea has been cited as one of the earliest-known ceramic sites from the southern Papuan lowlands. This site has long been seen as holding c.2000 year old evidence of post-Lapita long-distance maritime trade from (Austronesian-speaking) Motu homelands in the Central Province, where pottery was manufactured, to the (non-Austronesian) Gulf Province some 400km to the west where pottery was received and for which large quantities of sago were exchanged (the ancestral hiri trade). However, until now the only three radiocarbon dates available for Emo were out of chronostratigraphic sequence, and few details on the site had been published. This paper presents the results of new excavations and the first detailed series of AMS radiocarbon determinations from Emo, thereby resolving long-standing uncertainties about the age of the site and its implications for the antiquity of the long-distance Motuan hiri maritime trade.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This paper presents conclusive evidence for the presence of Lapita ceramics along the Papuan south coast between c. 2500 and 2900 cal. bp, thereby indicating that current models of colonization by ceramicists for the region need to be rethought.

We ask what the implications of such a site in a defensive location on the upper, steep hillslope of Kumukumu hill are for regional occupation and dynamics. We conclude that the hinterland-marine fringe islands of the river deltas that include the site of Kumukumu 1 were especially sensitive to heightened cross-cultural influences and inter-group raids and competition, leading to accelerated processes of centralisation and aggrandisement among some groups, and the subjugation, fragmentation and dispersal of less powerful neighbouring groups.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

David:2016ruisasi,"The history of pottery use along the south coast of Papua New Guinea spans from Lapita times, here dated to 2900–2600 cal BP, through to mass production of pottery associated with a number of ethnographically-known interaction (and exchange) networks. Understanding the antecedents and developmental histories of these interaction networks is of considerable importance to archaeological research from local to western Pacific geographical scales. The archaeological site of Ruisasi 1 located at Caution Bay near Port Moresby provides new insights into scales of pottery production before the development of the regional Motu hiri exchange system within the past 500 years. Here faunal remains indicate occupation by marine specialists who exploited a diverse range of local marine environments. Nearly 20,000 ceramic sherds are present in Square A, mostly from a 26 cm thick ‘pottery midden‘. A minimum of 45 red slip/plainware vessels based on conjoined sets of sherds plus two vessels with incised decoration are present; the maximum number of clay vessels based on Fabric Types is 155. The globular red slip/plainware pots have highly standardized shapes and sizes, consistent with mass pottery production. The concentration of sherds from these pots within the pottery midden reflects short-duration depositional events within the period of village life c. 1630–1220 cal BP. Whether or not the pots were made locally or imported is the subject of ongoing research.

While the archaeology goes back to the earliest period of Aboriginal occupation of the continent, the rock art represents some of the richest, most diverse and visually most impressive regional assemblages anywhere in the world. To better understand this multi-dimensional cultural record, The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia focuses on the nature and antiquity of the region's rock art as revealed by archaeological surveys and excavations, and the application of novel analytical methods. This volume also presents new findings by which to rethink how Aboriginal peoples have socially engaged in and with places across western Arnhem Land, from the north to the south, from the plains to the spectacular rocky landscapes of the plateau.

A horizon of wind-borne sediments containing flaked stone artefacts and charcoal commencing >45,610 cal BP (the young end of the modelled boundary age range, which extends beyond the limit of the calibration curve), with a median modelled age of 48,500 cal BP, signals the onset of aeolian mobilisation of fine sands and silts across the landscape, and re-deposition within the site at a time synchronous with the first evidence of people. This earliest cultural horizon (Stratigraphic Unit 4) contains 509 stone artefacts, and is marked by a contemporaneous sedimentary break, from underlying culturally sterile sediments consisting of disintegrating roof-fall and in situ sandstone and quartzite to overlying culturally-rich wind-blown sand. The new radiocarbon ages and wind-blown sediments together provide evidence for the commencement of noticeable landscape burning on the Arnhem Land plateau c. 48,500 cal BP, suggesting an intensification of landscape management practices at the summit of the Arnhem Land plateau some 10,000–15,000 years after the lowest dense band of artefacts (Phase 2) at Madjedbebe on the floodplains 90 km to the north.

David:2021late,"Understanding of Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions in Australia and New Guinea (Sahul) suffers from a paucity of reliably dated bone deposits. Researchers are divided as to when, and why, large-bodied species became extinct. Critical to these interpretations are so-called ‘late survivors‘, megafauna that are thought to have persisted for tens of thousands of years after the arrival of people. While the original dating of most sites with purported late survivors has been shown to have been erroneous or problematic, one site continues to feature: Cloggs Cave. Here we report new results that show that Cloggs Cave‘s youngest megafauna were deposited in sediments that date to 44,500-54,160 years ago, more than 10,000 years older than previously thought, bringing them into chronological alignment with the emerging continental pattern of megafaunal extinctions.

Detailed chronometric dating, combined with high-resolution 3D mapping, geomorphological studies and archaeological excavations, now allow a dense sequence of Late Holocene ash layers and their contents to be correlated with GunaiKurnai ethnography and current knowledge. These results suggest a critical re-interpretation of what the Old People were, and were not, doing in Cloggs Cave during the Late Holocene. Instead of a lack of Late Holocene cave occupation, as previously thought through the conceptual lens of ‘habitat and economy‘, Cloggs Cave is now understood to have been actively used for special, magical purposes. Configured by local GunaiKurnai cosmology, cave landscapes (including Cloggs Cave‘s) were populated not only by food species animals, but also by ‘supernatural‘ Beings and forces whose presence helped inform occupational patterns. The profound differences between the old and new archaeological interpretations of Cloggs Cave, separated by five decades of developing archaeological thought and technical advances, draw attention to archaeological meaning-making and highlight the significance of data capture and the pre-conceptions that shape the production of archaeological stories and identities of place.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Unlike other parts of Melanesia, however, at Caution Bay some of the Lapita sites also have pre-Lapita horizons. A number are culturally very rich. At Caution Bay, where the oldest confirmed Lapita finds date to no earlier than c. 2900 cal BP (McNiven et al. 2012a), the major questions do not concern the earliest expressions of Lapita around 3300–3400 cal BP. Rather, here we are concerned more with identifying how assemblages associated with the Lapita cultural complex arrived and transformed along the south coast, after a presence in coastal and island regions to the northeast over the previous 400 years. These concerns contain both spatial and temporal elements: how and when, as a prelude to why, particular cultural traits continued and changed across Caution Bay. Tanamu 1 is the first of 122 archaeological sites excavated in Caution Bay upon which we will report. As a site, it represents the ideal entry point, as being a coastal site which contains pre-Lapita, Lapita and post-Lapita horizons it encapsulates many of the signatures, trends and transformations seen across the >5000 year Caution Bay sequence at large. Of special note in the wider context of Lapita archaeology, the presence of rich pre-Lapita horizons is what makes Caution Bay so important both in and of itself and for the Lapita story.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,
Davidson:1976masters,"Three pollen diagrams were prepared to study Late Holocene vegetation change in the Kaikoura area. The vegetation on the Kahutara Hills has passed through a succession of formations; Leptospermum scrubland, Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest, pteridium fernland, and European grassland) over an undated time period. However, the Nothofagus element at Lake Rotoiti has remained relatively static and thus could imply that the core post dates the southward Nothofagus migration and spans about 6000 years. Fire throughout has been a constant feature of the environment, but correlates with the vegetation fonnations, suggesting that it may be responsible for the changes. The highest frequencies of fire correlate with the pteridium fernland and lowest frequencies with the Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest. Most of the fires were probably natural, however man has been at least partly responsible in the last 1000 years. The vegetation on the Kaikoura Peninsula, determined from dated pollen diagrams from Wairepo Lagoon and Mudstone Bay show that the vegetation has remained unaltered for 400 years. There is no record of the Podocarp-mixed hardwood forest recorded by Moar, (in Duckmanton, 1974), supposedly destroyed at about 300 years B.P. High charcoal frequencies, derived from Polynesian fires, could explain the lack of vegetation change. The environmental change of barrier beach building recorded by Duckmanton (1974), can be attributed to fire caused cliff instability and to Polynesian burning in the Kowhai and Hapuku Catchments. A coincidental tectonic uplift caused the barrier beaches to move and to enclose areas of shore platform behind which lagoons developed, slope deposits covering lagoonal peats (Duckmanton, 1974) are considered to be due to Maori Pa building. Sedimentation in European Times varied considerably. Silting at Lake Rotoiti, 4.5cms/10 years, was very rapid. On the Peninsula the effect of the European varied, from no effect at Wairepo Lagoon to a marked increase at Mudstone Bay. The pollen analysis however records no significant effect of the European on vegetation structure other than the change to introduced grassland.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Davis:1978sediments,"Paleoclimatic interpretation of the fossil pollen record uses both the distribution limits of species and their abundances. In each case the relationship of the plants to modern climate is used to interpret past occurrences. Problems arise in using pollen to determine accurately either the distribution of a species in space or its abundance, but the real limitation of the method seems to be lack of understanding of the role of climate in controlling plant species. The distribution data seem to give more precise paleoclimate estimates, but the approach leads to consideration of each species in isolation. The use of abundances, because it relies so heavily on interpretation of pollen assemblages, places more emphasis on the entire community and its relation to regional climate. Here the major difficulty comes in understanding unique communities that differ from modern analogues. They may differ because of biological factors such as immigration lag yet reflect a climate fully analogous to modern climate. Or they may indicate a unique combination of climatic conditions that has evoked a unique vegetation response. Complicating these interpretations are interactions among species, which can produce changes in abundance that mimic the effect of climatic change. Species interactions, although difficult to unravel from climatic effects in the fossil record, have potential for showing how changes in the physical environment influence the outcome of competition in plant communities.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

DCosta:1995terang,"Analyses of pollen and charcoal from lake and swamp deposits accumulated in a maar crater are used to reconstruct palaeoenvironments at and around Terang, Western Victoria. Changes in the nature of the sediments and in aquatic and dryland pollen indicate substantial climatic variation within the recorded period. Pollen assemblages indicate changes from open woodland, herbfield and grassland to wet sclerophyll forest, and from ephemeral swamp to permanent lake and swamp conditions within the basin. A possible timescale for the Lake Terang sequence is inferred from comparison with the better dated, nearby Lake Wangoom sequence and with the deep sea core record. The Terang record is considered to span a large part of the last glacial period and the Holocene, extending the available record of past vegetation and environments from the region by some 25,000 years to around 75,000 yr B.P. Conditions during the earlier part of the last glacial period were cooler and drier than today with open Casuarina woodland predominating in the region. At times, particularly towards the end of this period, conditions are considered to have been more extreme as much of the pollen is oxidised. A major interstadial, whose termination is tentatively dated at about 48,000 yr B.P. was dominated by Eucalyptus forest under effective precipitation levels similar to those of today. The latter part of the last glacial period is considered to have been cold and dry although no pollen is preserved except during a short phase of amelioration, probably around 39,000 yr B.P. The Holocene has been characterised by mixed Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland and forest until recent changes brought about by European people.

This procedure allows some suggestions as to likely annual temperatures and precipitation levels. A range of dating techniques including radiocarbon, thermoluminescence, uranium/thorium, electron spin resonance and amino acid racemisation, has been applied to the Egg Lagoon sequence. Despite the application of a variety of methods, a realistic chronology for much of the Egg Lagoon sequence could not be constructed on this basis alone. Instead a preferred chronology for the Egg Lagoon record was established by reference to oxygen isotopic chronology,, palaeoclimatic estimates and pollen evidence from other long records in south-eastern Australia and supported, in general terms, by the dating results. The established chronology indicates that the sequence commences in the Early Pleistocene. There is then a major discontinuity in the sequence. Sedimentation recommences in the penultimate glacial (=oxygen isotopic stage 6) with the derived pollen record spanning most, if not all, of the last interglacialglacial cycle, probably providing one of the most detailed pollen records for the last interglacial period in south-eastern Australia. The analysis of two cores from Egg Lagoon provides some basis for an examination of spatial as well as temporal variation in the vegetation at the site through much of this time. The presence of a number of hiatuses in the record is suspected with the record for much of the last glacial period absent. The Holocene record at Egg Lagoon is also probably condensed and possibly discontinuous. Evidence for the last 4,000 years B.P. is provided by a pollen record derived from nearby Lake Flannigan. The following major environmental changes are evident at northern King Island. During the Early Pleistocene Egg Lagoon existed as a marine embayment with foraminiferal and malaecological assemblages similar to those of curre11t King lslartd marine settings. A major discontinuity is indicated by stream inciriion of these marine sediments. Sedimentation recommences in the penultimate glacial (=isotopic stage 6). Regional grassland and herbfields existing under cooler and drier conditions than present are inferred. Climatic conditions similar to present were established between~ 130,000 - 122,000 years B.P. (= isotopic stage 5e) with regional sclerophyll woodland or open forest present. Maximum extent of closed forest occurred under cooler (up to 2-3°C less than present) and wetter (+300 - 400mm) climatic conditions between 122,000 and 110,000 years B.P. Between ~110,000 and 91,000 years B.P. a drier sclerophyll forest type was establisitied under temperature and rainfall regimes similar to present. Between ~91,000 and 74,000 years B.P. a sclerophyll forest with an increasing Casuarinaceae and heath component occurred under similar to prf.sent annual temperature and slightly reduced annual rainfall. Between ~59,000 and 12,000 years B.P. (cool and drier than present climatic conditions were established with regional grasslands and herbfields present from atround 30,000 years B.P. Modem vegetation and climatic conditions were established early in the Holocene. The shorter, more detailed record from Lake Flannigan suggests that climate has been stable over the past 4,000 years B.P. The record derived from Egg Lagoon allows some examination of the history of closed forest taxa on King Island. Closed forest taxa appear to have reached their greatest extent between 122,000 and 110,000 years B.P. under cooler and wetter than present conditions. Closed forest representation then dedined, most likely due to adverse climatic conditions. The local extinction of Nothofagus) a tricolporate Cunoniaceae and Tubuliflorites pleistocenicus are suggested within the timespan represented by the Egg Lagoon sequence but the cause(s) cannot be determined with any certainty. Microscopic charcoal from the palaeoenvironmental records provides possible evidence for the arrival or people on King Island up to 40,000 years before the earliest archaeological evidence in Tasmania, although dating uncertainties mean that increased charcoal values may be recorded at a similar time to the oldest Tasmanian archaeological evidence. Reduced charcoal levels in the Holocene coincide with archaeological and historical evidence for the abandonment of the Island by people.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
DCosta:2009dargaville,"Multiproxy analysis of two swamps, representative of numerous sites in the Dargaville area, provide a Holocene record of a transition from flooded marine valleys to freshwater swamp-forests. Dendrochronology of subfossil wood from these and other associated sites provide a record of kauri (Agathis) growth and demise over 3600 calendar years. A discrepancy between the abundance of kauri pollen and the timing of maximum kauri forest development, as revealed by dendrochronology, suggests that kauri pollen abundance at our sites is determined by the wetness of the substrate rather than by proximity of source trees. This finding has implications for the palaeoclimatic interpretation of late Quaternary Agathis pollen curves. Kauri has been present in the Dargaville area for more than 7000 14C yr BP with suitable conditions for the preservation of wood leading to an apparent expansion in Agathis population after ~3600 cal. yr BP rather than representing a southerly migration of this species.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
DeDeckker:2021kangaroo,"A palynological record spanning the last glacial--interglacial period was derived from high-resolution, deep-sea core MD03-2607, located near Kangaroo Island in South Australia. The core site lies opposite the mouth of the River Murray that, together with the Darling River, drains the extensive (∼1.6 x 106 km2) Murray-Darling Basin (MDB). The record comprises 120 samples and is compared with detailed records of sea-surface temperature (SST), the C3/C4 plant ratio obtained from the δ13C of n-alkanes from leaf waxes, the fluvial clay fraction and its neodymium isotopic composition, airborne dust and the biomass-burning component levuglosan. The chronology of the core is robust; it is built on 24 radiocarbon dates derived from planktic foraminifera, 16 optically stimulated luminescence dates, plus 12 tie points linked to the astronomically tuned marine isotopic record. Algal remains are found in nearly all samples supporting our postulation that the palynoflora is predominantly waterborne. Major findings are that the gymnosperm Callitris, together with high percentages of herb pollen (mostly C3 plants), is predominant during cold, arid phases, whereas Eucalyptus, is predominant during warmer and wetter periods. High charcoal concentration coincides with high percentages of Eucalyptus, mostly during wet and warm periods. Using the geochemistry of the core's fluvial sediments, it has been possible to identify when water-transported palynoflora and charcoal originated from the Murray sub-basin (consisting of the River Murray and its main tributaries but not from central or western South Australia). During those periods, rainfall principally originated from the southeastern Indian Ocean. When the Darling sub-basin was the main source of the palynoflora, rainfall must have instead originated from northern Australia. The eolian dust record from the core shows that the dust signal generally coincides with the increased values in herb pollen, in particular during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when, in addition to high herb percentages, Callitris representation also increased. This dry landscape taxon likely colonised the then-exposed Lacepede Shelf during this period of extreme low sea-level. There is a good correspondence between SST and mean annual precipitation reconstructed from the pollen counts. During warm phases in the ocean, Eucalyptus was the dominant tree taxon, especially for the entirety of Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5, plus MIS 3 and MIS 1. Charcoal levels were particularly low during the dry phases MIS 4 and 2, and even more so during the LGM.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Delannoy:2020borologa,"Archaeologists usually see, and understand, rock shelters as taphonomically active, but pre-existing, physical structures onto which people undertake a variety of actions including rock art. Our aim in this paper is not only to document the changes undergone by rock shelters but also to identify traces of anthropic actions that have intentionally led to these changes. Recent research in northern Australia provides empirical evidence that for thousands of years, Aboriginal peoples altered the physical shape of rock shelters by removing masses of rock to create alcoves, restructure internal spaces and create stone-worked furniture. Through archaeomorphological research, this paper presents evidence from Borologa in Australia’s Kimberley region, where hard quartzite monoliths were shaped and engaged as architectural designs by Aboriginal people prior to painting many surfaces, making us rethink what have traditionally been distinguished as natural versus cultural dimensions of archaeological landscapes and rock art sites.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

DeLong:2017andreas,"Relative horizontal motion along strike-slip faults can build mountains when motion is oblique to the trend of the strike-slip boundary. The resulting contraction and uplift pose off-fault seismic hazards, which are often difficult to detect because of the poor vertical resolution of satellite geodesy and difficulty of locating offset datable landforms in active mountain ranges. Sparse geomorphic markers, topographic analyses, and measurement of denudation allow us to map spatiotemporal patterns of uplift along the northern San Andreas fault. Between Jenner and Mendocino, California, emergent marine terraces found southwest of the San Andreas fault record late Pleistocene uplift rates between 0.20 and 0.45 mm yr–1 along much of the coast. However, on the northeast side of the San Andreas fault, a zone of rapid uplift (0.6–1.0 mm yr–1) exists adjacent to the San Andreas fault, but rates decay northeastward as the coast becomes more distant from the San Andreas fault. A newly dated 4.5 Ma shallow-marine deposit located at ∼500 m above sea level (masl) adjacent to the San Andreas fault is warped down to just 150 masl 15 km northeast of the San Andreas fault, and it is exposed at just 60–110 masl to the west of the fault. Landscape denudation rates calculated from abundance of cosmogenic radionuclides in fluvial sediment northeast of, and adjacent to, the San Andreas fault are 0.16–0.29 mm yr–1, but they are only 0.03–0.07 mm yr–1 west of the fault. ...

Delunel:2010pelvoux,"The potential tectonic and climatic controls on erosion rates in the European Alps and other mountain belts remain strongly debated. We have quantified denudation rates at catchment scales using in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides (10Be) in stream sediments, sampled at the outlets of twelve variously sized (27–1072 km2) catchments of the Ecrins–Pelvoux massif (French Western Alps), with average elevations ranging from 1700 to 2800 m. Spatially-averaged denudation rates, corrected for potential shielding by Little Ice Age glaciers, vary from 0.27 ± 0.05 to 1.07 ± 0.20 mm/yr on millennial timescales. Our results exhibit a correlation (ρ2 = 0.56) between denudation rate and mean catchment elevation, in the absence of significant correlation with any other morphometric parameters (relief, slope, catchment size, hypsometry, etc). Although such variations in erosion rates have been previously linked to variations in tectonic uplift rate, the relatively small size and tectonic homogeneity of our study area exclude a strongly variable tectonic control. We interpret the increase in erosion rate with elevation as the effect of frost-controlled processes, which are strongly temperature-dependent. We use a one-dimensional heat-flow model driven by high-resolution instrumental temperature records from the study area to correlate the variability in denudation rates with the integral of the absolute temperature gradient within the frost-cracking window (− 3 to − 8 °C), a proxy of the frost-cracking intensity, for each catchment. The results imply that the efficiency of frost cracking constitutes a major control on catchment-wide denudation rates in the study area, explaining more than half the measured variability in these rates. Our study shows that present-day denudation of the Ecrins–Pelvoux massif is controlled by a climatically driven factor and suggests that frost-cracking processes impose an important control on the post-glacial topographic evolution of mid-latitude mountain belts.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Delunel:2013etages,"Although beryllium‐10 (10Be) concentrations in stream sediments provide useful synoptic views of catchment‐wide erosion rates, little is known on the relative contributions of different sediment supply mechanisms to the acquisition of their initial signature in the headwaters. Here we address this issue by conducting a 10Be‐budget of detrital materials that characterize the morphogenetic domains representative of high‐altitude environments of the European Alps. We focus on the Etages catchment, located in the Ecrins‐Pelvoux massif (southeast France), and illustrate how in situ 10Be concentrations can be used for tracing the origin of the sand fraction from the bedload in the trunk stream. The landscape of the Etages catchment is characterized by a geomorphic transient state, high topographic gradients, and a large variety of modern geomorphic domains ranging from glacial environments to scarcely vegetated alluvial plains. Beryllium‐10 concentrations measured in the Etages catchment vary from ~1 × 104 to 4.5 × 105 atoms per gram quartz, while displaying consistent 10Be signatures within each representative morphogenetic unit. We show that the basic requirements for inferring catchment‐wide denudation from 10Be concentration measurements are not satisfied in this small, dynamic catchment. However, the distinct 10Be signature observed for the geomorphic domains can be used as a tracer. We suggest that a terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) budget approach provides a valuable tool for the tracing of material origin in basins where the ‘let nature do the averaging’ principles may be violated.

Using a homogeneized framework, we employ state-of-the-art techniques for inverting in-situ 10Be concentrations into denudation rates. From our compilation, we find that (i) while lithologic properties and precipitation/runoff do influence erosion mechanisms and rates at the scale of individual catchments and in some specific Alpine regions, such controls do not directly stand for the entire Alps, (ii) as also previously suggested, catchment-wide denudation rates across the entire European Alps closely follow first-order Alpine topographic metrics at the scale of individual catchments or selected Alpine sub-regions. However, in addition to previous local-scale studies conducted in the European Alps, our large-scale compila- tion highlights a functional relationship between catchment-wide denudation and mean catchment slope angle. ...

DelVecchio:2018pennsylvania,"We sought to understand the time scale, mechanisms, and extent of landscape modification in unglaciated central Pennsylvania by studying sediment moving through and stored in a sandstone headwater valley. In this landscape, the timing and extent of landscape modification are poorly constrained, and it is unclear whether, and how much, periglacial processes drive landscape evolution during cold glacial periods. Our investigation pairs geomorphic mapping with in situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al measurements of surface material and buried clasts to estimate the residence time and depositional history of colluvium within Garner Run, a 1 km2 headwater valley in the central Appalachian Mountains containing relict Pleistocene periglacial features, including solifluction lobes, boulder fields, and thick colluvial toe-slope deposits. The preservation of periglacial landforms into the present interglacial suggests active hillslope sediment transport in cold climates followed by only limited modification in the Holocene. The 10Be concentrations of stream sediment and hillslope regolith indicate slow erosion rates (6.6 ± 0.6 m m.y.-1) over the past ~100 k.y. From 26Al/10Be burial dating of valley-bottom deposits recovered from a 9 m drill core, we infer two pulses of deposition since 340 ± 80 ka, a record that spans at least three glacial terminations and implies limited removal of valley-bottom deposits during interglacial periods. ...

Denham:2003thesis,"Previous claims for the early and independent origins of agriculture in New Guinea were based, in part, on the findings of multi-disciplinary investigations at Kuk Swamp, Wahgi Valley, Papua New Guinea. During investigations undertaken in the 1970s under the direction of Jack Golson, six phases of wetland drainage for agriculture were identified. The earliest three phases, Phase 1 (10,220-9910 Cal BP), Phase 2 (6950-6440 Cal BP) and Phase 3 (4350->2800 Cal BP), all pre-date known Austronesian influence on the island, are potentially significant in determining the early and independent origins of agriculture in New Guinea and are investigated in this thesis. In the introduction to the thesis, problems with the previous characterisation of Phases 1, 2 and 3 at Kuk are raised. The problems centre on the limited archaeobotanical evidence of former cultivated plants, the limited palaeoecological evidence for attendant environmental transformations and the uncertain archaeological significance of the features and finds encountered on the wetland margin. The multi-disciplinary research documented in this thesis addresses these problems with the intention of determining whether the early three phases at Kuk represent agriculture, and whether claims of early and independent agricultural origins in New Guinea are valid. Published accounts of Phases 1, 2 and 3 at Kuk and other sites located in the interior of New Guinea are critically reviewed, together with other potential lines of evidence relevant to the origins of agriculture debate. ...

Early agriculture in the highlands is charted by an exposition of the practices of plant exploitation and cultivation.

Denham:2019manim,"The term ‘Neolithic’ was proposed by Lubbock (1865) as a formal category to differentiate the Palaeolithic—namely, old flaked stone technologies—from new ground and polished stone technologies. Subsequently, a range of alternative meanings of the Neolithic have emerged (Trigger 2003). Childe (1925) shifted the emphasis from evolutionary perspectives on stone tool technology onto sets of culture-historic traits, albeit with temporal and geographical variation. During the 20th century, the concept of the Neolithic broadened to encompass agriculture (associated with domesticated plants and animals), sedentism, pottery and mortuary practices, as well as stone tool technology. Subsequently, Hodder (1990) drew attention to the social and symbolic aspects of the Neolithic, while Thomas (1999) considered the Neolithic to be more a way of ‘Being’. Today, in both academic and public discourse, the Neolithic has become a signifier of social complexity, dynamism and progression (David and Denham 2006; Florin and Carah 2018). It remains to be seen how relevant the concept of the Neolithic is outside Eurasia, the region of its original development and application.

Densmore:2009footwalls,"We test the spatial correspondence between rock uplift in active normal fault footwalls in the western USA, and catchment-averaged denudation rates from cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) analysis. We find that denudation rates vary along strike, depending on the fault length and displacement. For the 18-km-long Sweetwater fault, foot-wall relief is largely inherited from the prefaulting topography, and denudation rates are only partly reflective of fault displacement. For the 130-km-long Wassuk fault, all inherited topography has been removed by erosion in response to fault displacement. Denudation rates, however, show little along-strike consistency and no correlation with catchment size or morphology. We argue that, in the early stages of fault growth, CRN-derived denudation rates reflect inherited prefaulting relief, with an overprint of fault-controlled erosion. In later stages of fault growth, rates are decoupled from fault displacement through the impact of stochastic landsliding events, and longer term measures of denudation (such as low-temperature thermochronometry) that integrate over multiple earthquakes may provide a better record of spatial variations in rock uplift.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Derrieux:2014taiwan,"Quantifying denudation rates in a wide range of climatic and tectonic settings at various time and space scales is a critical step in calibrating and validating landscape evolution models. Focusing on Taiwan, we quantified centennial rates of denudation at the scale of the whole orogen, using in situ 10Be concentrations measured in stream sediments collected at the outlets of major rivers. To assess denudation rates that are statistically significant, we applied both the mean square weighted deviation approach and the bootstrap technique. For the central segment of the belt, where the collision is considered to be near mature, the orogen-scale pattern of denudation shows a two-fold pattern: (1) higher denudation values on the order of 4–5 mm/yr characterize the eastern side of the belt (i.e., retro-wedge), with a slight increase towards the south and (2) lower denudation values on the order of 1–3 mm/yr on the western side of the belt (pro-wedge) with a minimum value centered on the main recess of the deformation front. To the north and to the south of the central segment, the denudation rates converge towards lower values on the order of 2–3 mm/yr. At the scale of the mountain belt, drainage basin metrics such as relief, hypsometric index and slope values seem to explain the observed variance in the data population, conversely to the first-order average precipitation pattern, suggesting a strong tectonic control on the regional pattern of denudation rates. Applied to the whole orogen, such field-based approach thus provides important input data to validate and calibrate the parameters to be supplied to landscape evolution models.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dethier:2014rocky,"We used measurements of cosmogenic 10Be in alluvium to estimate erosion rates on a 103–104 yr time scale for small (0.01–47 km2), unglaciated basins in northern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and adjacent western Nebraska (western United States). Basins formed in Proterozoic cores of Laramide ranges are eroding more slowly (23 ± 7 mm k.y.–1, n = 19) than adjacent basins draining weakly lithified Cenozoic sedimentary rocks (75 ± 36 mm k.y. –1, n = 20). Erosion rates show a relationship to rock resistance and, for granitic rocks, to basin slope, but not to mean annual precipitation. We estimated longer-term (>105 yr time scale) erosion rates for the granitic core of the Front Range by measuring the concentration of 10Be and 26Al produced mainly by muon interactions at depths 1.7–10 m below the surface. Concentrations imply erosion rates of 9–31 mm k.y. –1, similar to shorter-term erosion rates inferred from alluvial sediment. The spatial distribution of erosion rates and stratigraphic evidence imply that relief in the southern Rocky Mountains increased in the late Cenozoic; modern relief probably dates from post-middle Miocene time.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Dettmann:1998proteaceae,"The early history of the Proteaceae in Australia is traced from the record of fossil pollen that possess characters having taxonomic resolution among extant members of the family. Pollen characters useful for segregating subfamilies and generic groups are apertural number and form together with exine stratification and structure. When considered in conjunction with pollen shape, polarity, and size and exine sculpturing, they may be used to discriminate generic and/or species groups. The fossil pollen record suggests that the family originated in northern Gondwana during the late Cenomanian and radiated by as yet unidentified routes into southern high latitudes during the Turonian. There the family underwent substantial differentiation and expansion during Santonian–Maastrichtian times when at least four of the seven extant subfamilies evolved. Although diversification in Australia principally involved rainforest lineages (e.g. Macadamia–Helicia, Carnarvonia, Gevuina) ancestors of some sclerophyllous taxa (e.g. Adenanthos) also differentiated; this occurred in a regionalised vegetation of mesotherm open-forests in which podocarps and araucarians were important. Subsequent (Paleocene–Eocene) diversification and consolidation of the family may have focused on introduction and expansion of sclerophyllous lineages (e.g. Isopogon, Petrophile), but rainforest elements (e.g. Embothrium) were also involved. The associated vegetation, which was regionalised, experienced considerable floristic modifications during this time with introductions and/or expansion of an array of angiosperm taxa, notably Casuarinaceae, Myrtaceae and Nothofagus. In southern regions a marked decline in proteaceous pollen diversity and abundance occurred near the end of the Eocene, whereas in north-eastern regions the decline may have been later, during the Miocene.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,
Devoy:1994hawkesbury,"Rapid sedimentation of sands, silts and muds associated with seaward prograding tidal delta and central basin deposits, characterise the early Holocene sediment infill of the Hawkesbury River's estuary. From about 6 ka BP fluvial muds and sands dominate the estuary and sedimentation rates are much reduced. Micro-fossil records contained in sediments from the middle Hawkesbury-Colo Rivers region support the sedimentological-lithostratigraphic interpretation of estuary development. Information from fossil diatoms indicates that for a period of about 300 years around 6 ka BP, there was an increased marine influence in this part of the present estuary. This may have resulted from the probable peak in the rate of relative sea-level rise, although there may also have been a contemporaneous increase in freshwater flow down the river. Pollen and charcoal records from Mill Creek, downstream from the Colo sequence, show that sclerophyll forest, occasionally with rainforest elements, became more dominant from 8 ka BP. In contrast, the upper tidal Casuarina glauca forest decreased in importance during the phases of sea-level rise and the subsequent 'still-stand'. Together the palaeoenvironmental records show broad agreement in defining the patterns of regional environmental changes and linked phases of estuary development during the Holocene. Differences in records appear to relate to local site factors and to the limitations in provenance, persistence and resolving power of the data types. The rapid accumulation rates provide an opportunity to investigate high magnitude but low frequency events in estuarine environments, including floods and fire.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

DiBiase:2010gabriel,"It has been long hypothesized that topography, as well as climate and rock strength, exert first order controls on erosion rates. Here we use detrital cosmogenic 10Be from 50 basins, ranging in size from 1 to 150 km2, to measure millennial erosion rates across the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California, where a strong E–W gradient in relief compared to weak variation in precipitation and lithology allow us to isolate the relationship between topographic form and erosion rate. Our erosion rates range from 35 to 1100 m/Ma, and generally agree with both decadal sediment fluxes and long term exhumation rates inferred from low temperature thermochronometry. Catchment-mean hillslope angle increases with erosion rate until ∼ 300 m/Ma, at which point slopes become invariant with erosion rate. Although this sort of relation has been offered as support for non-linear models of soil transport, we use 1-D analytical hillslope profiles derived from existing soil transport laws to show that a model with soil flux linear in slope, but including a slope stability threshold, is indistinguishable from a non-linear law within the scatter of our data. Catchment-mean normalized channel steepness index increases monotonically, though non-linearly, with erosion rate throughout the San Gabriel Mountains, even where catchment-mean hillslope angles have reached a threshold. This non-linearity can be mostly accounted for by a stochastic threshold incision model, though additional factors likely contribute to the observed relationship between channel steepness and erosion rate. These findings substantiate the claim that the normalized channel steepness index is an important topographic metric in active ranges.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
DiBiase:2018womans,"Landscapes are thought to respond to changes in relative base level through the upstream propagation of a boundary that delineates relict from adjusting topography. However, spatially-variable rock strength can influence the topographic expression of such transient landscapes, especially in layered rocks, where strength variations can mask topographic signals expected due to changes in climate or tectonics. Here, we analyze the landscape response to base-level fall in Young Womans Creek, a 220 km2 catchment on the Appalachian Plateau, USA underlain by gently folded Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. We measured in situ 10Be concentrations in stream sands from 17 nested watersheds, and used a spatially-distributed model of sediment and 10Be production to constrain a threefold increase in the rate of base-level fall propagating upstream from the catchment outlet. Using lidar topography and a nearby detailed stratigraphic section, we map the extent of continuous, blocky, resistant sandstone strata that act as a caprock overlying more easily erodible sandstones and siltstones. The caprock influences landscape response in two ways. First, it serves as a boundary between slowly eroding (11.5 m Myr−1), low-sloping (3–5°) areas of relict topography and lower, steeper portions of the landscape adjusting to base-level fall. Second, hillslopes supported by the overlying caprock are armored with coarse sediment and are significantly steeper (20–30°) than hillslopes where the caprock has been eroded (10°), despite having similar erosion rates (36 m Myr−1) and bedrock substrate. Our results illustrate how gently dipping, layered rocks engender complicated relationships between lithology, topography and erosion rate, highlighting the importance of understanding how rock material properties influence surface processes and landscape evolution.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In the Kimberley region of northwest Western Australia, human responses to ENSO driven climate change are most evident archaeologically in technological transformations observed in lithic records, with little research on changes in plant use during this time. Using nine archaeological sites across the Kimberley, this paper synthesises previously published macrobotanical data (Carpenter’s Gap 1, Moonggaroonggoo, Mount Behn, and Riwi), reports unpublished data (Brooking Gorge 1, Djuru, and Wandjina rockshelter), and presents results of sites reanalysed for this study (Widgingarri Shelters 1 and 2) to develop a picture of localised and regional patterns of plant use during the Holocene.

Dillenburg:2020complex,"This study examines the southeastern end of the Younghusband Peninsula in South Australia at a location called The Granites in order to gain a better understanding of the processes of formation of the foredune ridge system, and to investigate the drivers that controlled its progradational development during the Holocene. Our findings are based on a morphological analysis, a ground penetrating radar survey, and 14C and OSL dating. The Younghusband Peninsula at The Granites was formed by an initial aggradational phase resulting in a single complex foredune ridge, and which ended around 4.3 ka, and by a regressive (progradational) barrier phase (750 m wide) that developed in the last 4.3 ka, under very low rates of progradation (0.38 to 0.09 m/yr). The last part of this phase shows significant foredune ridge building in the last 1000 years or so. Barrier progradation via foredune ridge development is likely an effect driven by low wave energy that favored conditions for coastal stability and foredune formation. Paleontological and GPR data indicate a maximum sea-level of +1.23 to +1.5 m, respectively, during initial barrier development. The foredune ridge plain of the barrier experienced at least three phases of significant aeolian activity with ages centered at around 3.9, 3.4 and 3.0 ka suggesting their occurrence at 500 to 400-year events. Computer modelling indicates that sediments for the progradational phase of the barrier were provided by the forced regression produced by a sea-level fall over the past 4.3 ka. The large foredune complex formed during the last phase of progradation could be the result of both the very low progradation rate of 0.09 m/yr, and periods of disturbance possibly related to enhanced storm activity.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Dingle:2018variability,"Accurately quantifying sediment fluxes in large rivers draining tectonically active landscapes is complicated by the stochastic nature of sediment inputs. Cosmogenic 10Be concentrations measured in modern river sands have been used to estimate 102- to 104-year sediment fluxes in these types of catchments, where upstream drainage areas are often in excess of 10 000 km2. It is commonly assumed that within large catchments, the effects of stochastic sediment inputs are buffered such that 10Be concentrations at the catchment outlet are relatively stable in time. We present 18 new 10Be concentrations of modern river and dated Holocene terrace and floodplain deposits from the Ganga River near to the Himalayan mountain front (or outlet). We demonstrate that 10Be concentrations measured in modern Ganga River sediments display a notable degree of variability, with concentrations ranging between ∼9000 and 19 000 atoms g−1. We propose that this observed variability is driven by two factors. Firstly, by the nature of stochastic inputs of sediment (e.g. the dominant erosional process, surface production rates, depth of landsliding, degree of mixing) and, secondly, by the evacuation timescale of individual sediment deposits which buffer their impact on catchment-averaged concentrations. Despite intensification of the Indian Summer Monsoon and subsequent doubling of sediment delivery to the Bay of Bengal between ∼11 and 7 ka, we also find that Holocene sediment 10Be concentrations documented at the Ganga outlet have remained within the variability of modern river concentrations. We demonstrate that, in certain systems, sediment flux cannot be simply approximated by converting detrital concentration into mean erosion rates and multiplying by catchment area as it is possible to generate larger volumetric sediment fluxes whilst maintaining comparable average 10Be concentrations. ...

Basin-averaged erosion rates for six sub-catchments draining the CoH show a narrow range (3.00 ± 0.28 to 4.15 ± 0.37 m/Mega-annum [Ma]; ±1σ) regardless of catchment size or underlying geology; e.g. the sub-catchment with Malapa Cave (3 km2) underlain by dolomite erodes at the same rate (3.30 ± 0.30 m/Ma) as the upper Skeerpoort River catchment (87 km2) underlain by shale, chert and conglomerate (3.23 ± 0.30 m/Ma).

The rock shelter was used between 15000 and 7000 calBP, and provides insights into how Aboriginal people interacted with a changing coastal landscape throughout postglacial sea-level rise. The faunal record reflects this fluctuating local landscape. The late Pleistocene faunal assemblage largely consists of arid plains terrestrial fauna, and then transitions to a diverse marine invertebrate taxa midden. This record demonstrates coastal resource use throughout the terminal Pleistocene, before the expansion of mangrove forests across northern Australia. The stone artefact assemblages indicate varied expedient reduction patterns. The assemblages include artefacts manufactured from local limestone and non-local sources. Our analyses indicate that occupation durations at JWCR were longer during the late Pleistocene compared to the early Holocene, when productive mangrove environments became proximal. The implications of these results are twofold. First, effective use of coastal plain environments was probably just as important for coastal occupation as marine resource procurement. Second, the presence of relatively dense marine faunal assemblages is not necessarily a reliable proxy for individual coastal-site occupational intensity under conditions of local resource productivity.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dixon:2016alps,"What is the influence of glacial processes in driving erosion and uplift across the European Alps? It has largely been argued that repeated erosion and glaciation sustain isostatic uplift and topography in a decaying orogen. But some parts of the Alps may still be actively uplifting via deep lithospheric processes. We add insight to this debate by isolating the role of post-glacial topographic forcing on erosion rates. To do this, we quantify the topographic signature of past glaciation on millennial-scale erosion rates in previously glaciated and unglaciated catchments at the easternmost edge of the Austrian Alps. Newly measured catchment-wide erosion rates, determined from cosmogenic 10Be in river-borne quartz, correlate with basin relief and mean slope. GIS-derived slope–elevation and slope–area distributions across catchments provide clear topographic indicators of the degree of glacial preconditioning, which further correlates with erosion rates. Erosion rates in the easternmost, non-glaciated basins range from 40 to 150 mm ky−1 and likely reflect underlying tectonic forcings in this region, which have previously been attributed to recent (post 5 Ma) uplift. By contrast, erosion rates in previously glaciated catchments range from 170 to 240 mm ky−1 and reflect the erosional response to local topographic preconditioning by repeated glaciations. Together, these data suggest that Holocene erosion across the Eastern Alps is strongly shaped by the local topography relict from previous glaciations. Broader, landscape-wide forcings, such as the widely debated deep mantle-driven or isostatically driven uplift, result in lesser controls on both topography and erosion rates in this region. Comparing our data to previously published erosion rates across the Alps, we show that post-glacial erosion rates vary across more than 2 orders of magnitude. This high variation in post-glacial erosion may reflect combined effects of direct tectonic and modern climatic forcings but is strongly overprinted by past glacial climate and its topographic legacy.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dodson:1986barrington,"Pollen analyses from eight sites and fifty-seven radiocarbon analyses from nine sites are described to give a vegetation history and chronology across the Barrington Tops Plateau. It is shown that sites record local plant community history, and that between-site comparisons enable identification of vegetation change across the Plateau. At present, the area above 1000 m supports a mosaic of sub-alpine grasslands, mon- tane eucalypt forests, wet eucalypt formations, cool-temperate rainforests and wetland communities. By 9000 BP these had all been well established but there have been changes in the contributions of each vegetation type to the mosaic. In the period from 6500 to 3500 BP, cool temperate rainforest covered a larger area of the Plateau in the east, while wet eucalypt forests were more extensive in the west than at the present. This could have resulted from an increase in temperature and in summer rain-bearing winds from the south and east. Retreat of these forest types began around 5000 BP and by 1600 BP large areas on the west were replaced by montane eucalypts with a sub-alpine grassland understorey. Some expansion of cool-temperate rainforest began in the same region from about 1500 BP, although this was mainly restricted to sheltered localities. In the wetland areas there was a general trend from open water with aquatics to higher productivity with sedges and Sphagnum-forming hum- mock/hollow communities around 3500 BP. Peat formation then became widespread and expanded within the last few centuries when further wetland areas became established, particularly in the Gloucester Tops region. The forest retreats from 5000 BP until 1600 BP and hydroseral change from 3500 BP probably resulted from lower temperatures. The most recent expansion of Nothofagus and the wetlands is thought to be due to an increase in rainfall and possibly temperature. Fire records were compiled from four sites by analysing fine charcoal particle inputs. These show that the incidence and/or intensity of fires increased from low levels around 3000 BP. However, no major vegetation shifts could be directly attributed to fire. Some taxa, however, were sensitive to fire and the abundance of Casuarina torulosa in eucalypt forest in the south-eastern part of the Plateau was strongly reduced by burning. The role of Aboriginals and Europeans in the fire-ecology of the Bar- rington Tops area is unclear, but it is possible that their burning con- tributed to certain events in its Holocene vegetation history.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Dodson:1986goulburn,"Three sites from Breadalbane Basin and one from Wet Lagoon near Goulburn were studied to provide a history of vegetation, fire and lake levels in the region. Stratigraphy, a percentage pollen diagram from each site, an influx diagram from two sites and 29 radiocarbon analyses provided the basic data and chronology of the study. The sedimentary history shows that Breadalbane Basin has undergone several cycles of lake phases with sediment accumulation and dry phases with deflation of the lake sediments. The present lake clays and silts of Breadalbane Basin and Wet Lagoon are all Holocene in age. A lake began forming in Breadalbane Basin before 9300 B.P. and probably reached its greatest extent between 7400 and 2700 B.P. At Wet Lagoon water stands were in evidence from 5000 B.P. Over the last 2000 years the sites have dried out and are ephemeral swamps but their water level histories are not necessarily synchronous. A comparison of the records shows that the vegetation of the region has been open eucalypt woodland with understorey dominated by grasses and herbaceous taxa. The most dramatic change was woodland clearance after the arrival of European settlers. The spread of pollen and charcoal collection sites, however, emphasizes a number of local differences in the vegetation of the region. Casuarina, for example, expanded during the mid Holocene along the escarpment on the western side of Breadalbane Basin. The charcoal input curves show fire was a frequent occurrence in the region but the vegetation was apparently resilient to its effects until European settlers used it as a tool in woodland clearance.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Sedimentation rates were low, but increased markedly about 3000 yr B.P. and again around 500 yr B.P. as a result of regional climatic change. A comparison of the results with other environmental data from the region suggests that conditions in the early Holocene were warmer and moister than at present, but that cooler and drier environments developed about 3000 yr B.P.

This was the warmest and probably most mesic environment represented in the record. Nothofagus was never an important element and Dacrydium cupressinum, Podocarpus spp. and tree ferns dominated throughout. Agathis australis expanded from c11 500 BP but declined after 3000 BP, perhaps associated with increased droughtiness.

Dodson:1993cuddie,"We report the first site in Australia with a dated association of human technology and megafauna, in a palaeoenvironmental context. There are few sites in Australia where evidence of humans and Pleistocene megafauna coincide (Flannery and Gott, 1984; Flood, 1983 151-159; Gillespie et al., 1978; Gorecki et al., 1984). Such coincidences are often poorly dated or undated due to their antiquity or stratigraphic context. Cuddie Springs contains several distinct concentrations of megafaunal bone, in addition to a scatter of bone through all the sediments examined. Most of the deposit is beyond radiocarbon dating but an upper portion of sediment has been dated between 19,000 and 30,000 B.P. Artefacts and increased charcoal appear about 30,000 B.P. and then have a continuous presence. The artefact assemblage includes grindstones with starch residues, ochre, a probable cylcon and stone artefacts with reworked edges containing blood and hair. These combine to provide evidence of plant and animal processing and cultural practices at 30,000 B.P. The bones and artefacts were deposited when Cuddie Springs was a shallow freshwater lake surrounded by a relatively arid shrubland, the lake then became ephemeral and the environment more arid as the glacial maximum approached.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dodson:1993human,"There are few historical analyses quantifying impacts of human activity in Australia. This paper compares vegetation change, fire regime, erosion and eutrophication rates between the European period and the recent prehistoric past in two lake systems on the south coast of New South Wales. The variance in pollen abundance and hence species population changes increased markedly in the historical period, especially amongst understorey taxa, and this could be related to changes in the local fire regimes and to the effects of grazing. Local fire activity decreased from the prehistorical period at both sites. Erosion rates increased in the historical period and both organic and inorganic components were deposited in the lakes. Erosion episodes could be related to fire during some periods but are clearly controlled by forest disturbance and land-use at other periods. The trophic status of the lakes was increasing from before European settlement but accelerated in the recent past. This was in part due to the increased erosion rates and in part due to fertiliser application. The results suggest that lower rates of erosional and eutrophic change occur in catchments with basaltic than with Holocene sand substrata.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

This study compares the erosion, productivity, fire and vegetation history in prehistoric and historical times at Burraga Swamp in montane rainforest in New South Wales. The known human impact is meagre; the major presently sustained impacts involve forestry in the surrounding sclerophyll forests and a low level of visits to the swamp by day-walkers. While no significant changes in the largely oligotrophic conditions or in fire frequency were detected, changes in erosion rates and some vegetation change can be attributed to impacts since European settlement. There has been a small decline in eucalypts and a loss of fern cover, while grasses, Urtica and exotic species have expanded.

Focus is on vegetation dynamics, erosion, prodiictivity changes and thefire regime. Since European settlement there has been woodland clearance and recovery, the introduction of many plant and animal species and a significant increase in the intensity in the fire regime. While many direct linkages are apparent between environmental variables some operate over significant time lags. Fire has played a major role in vegetation dynamics and has favoured open ground taxa at the expense of Eucalyptus and Melaleuca.

While disturbance in the prehistoric period was found to be minimal and mainly activated by fire, the impact of land uses after European arrival initiated a change in the erosion and fire regime and brought new grazing animals and exotic plant species. These triggered temporal changes in eutrophication and the nature of erosion, and significant vegetation changes. There was a reduction in the stability and persistence of species representation, especially in herbfield vegetation, and little recovery is evident despite the cessation of summer grazing.

Dodson:1998ringarooma,"The relationship between sclerophyll forest and temperate rainforest in Tasmania is believed to be driven by climate, soils and fire regime; however, this has been tested infrequently on time frames relevant to the longevity of the major forest trees involved. This study uses sediments in four small hollows from within a rainforest stand in the Upper Ringarooma valley in northeastern Tasmania, Australia, to analyse vegetation dynamics and disturbance over the last 1000 years. Pollen-vegetation relationships were investigated by comparing pollen rain and current vegetation, and the chronology was established by radiocarbon and lead-210 dates. The lead-210 data indicate that the two Sphagnum humus profiles were not always closed systems for inorganic inwash; however, the pollen and charcoal records are generally consistent indicating that a mixed Eucalyptus-Nothofagus forest shifted to a Kothofagus dominated rainforest as fire became a less prominent component of the environment. About 400 years ago Leptospermum lanigerum invaded the community as canopy gaps developed, possibly as the older Nothofagus Cunninghamii trees died. There is no strong evidence of invasion by Atherosperma moschatum as suggested by some models of forest dynamics in these forests in Tasmania.

Dodson:2000byenup,"South-western Australia has a Mediterranean-type climate and its infertile soils support a highly diverse angiosperm flora. Little is known of the vegetation history of this region, and this means that little can be said of the roles of environmental stability, climate change, or human impact on the maintenance or development of the high biodiversity of the region. This study presents a pollen and fossil charcoal record from two peat profiles from a freshwater lagoon region near Lake Muir, east of Manjimup, in south-western Australia. The record shows a glimpse of an early Holocene where a mix of Casuarina and eucalypts with an understorey of heath and some open herbaceous vegetation, including chenopods, occurred. Fire was not an important factor at this time. The main record begins from about 4800 BP, and shows a vegetation mix of Corymbia calophylla and Eucalyptus marginata, with the latter becoming dominant by about 3500 BP. Corymbia calophylla again becomes prominent in the last few centuries. A heathy understorey is present throughout the last 4800 years, but was apparently less dense during phases when C. calophylla was more prominent. Melaleuca woodland has been the main vegetation type around the wetland areas and areas of inundation since the mid-Holocene. Major fire periods at Byenup, around 4200 BP and between about 3000 and 2000 BP, did not result in major vegetation changes. An analysis of cation content in the sediments suggests that weathering and erosion rates have been relatively stable throughout the record, but an increase in phosphorus and possibly organic matter in the surface layers suggests that agricultural practices have led to changes in the chemistry of sediments. It is hypothesised that an increase in effective precipitation about 4800 BP led to the initiation of the continuous part of the sediment record at Byenup. This increase most likely resulted from a more effective westerly wind stream. Changes since this time are more likely a result of changing fire regime and the interaction of species, rather than climate shifts.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Dodson:2001solomons,"Solomons Jewel Lake occurs in an area of subalpine woodland with patches of cool temperate rain forest and the conifer Athrotaxis cupressoides, which is found mainly along stream channels.

Apart from a reduction in Euicalyptus for about 300 years, beginning around 3500 BP, the sclerophyll vegetation has remained relatively unchanged. A small decline in rainforest taxa began around 1700 BP, followed by an expansion of Sphagnum from 1200 BP, then Athrotaxis cupressoides and Cyperaceae from 800-900 BP. These trends probably represent a chain of events associated with a cooling which reduced rain forest and allowed wetland areas to expand. These then provided additional habitat for Athrotavis cupressoides which expanded because the wetlands provided additional protection from fire.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Similar burial techniques have been described in the region's ethnographic literature, and this site represents the first known archaeological example. Ascertaining a firm date for the burial is problematic owing to the nature of the radiocarbon calibration curve in recent centuries.

Donders:2006fraser,"The dune system of Fraser Island in subtropical Queensland, Australia, contains numerous perched lakes with organic-rich sediments. These lakes are located in the subtropics and their water levels are strongly influenced by precipitation. The lakes act as natural rainfall gauges, which make them highly sensitive to environmental change. Paleoecological and paleoclimatological investigations are performed on sediment cores from Lake Allom, a small perched lake on central Fraser Island. A detailed chronology is based on a series of closely spaced AMS-radiocarbon dates, supplemented with sedimentological information. Based on extrapolation, the chronology indicates an age range from ∼56 14C kyr BP to present, with a major hiatus occurring during the Last Glacial Maximum. Pollen analysis of the Lake Allom sediment record reveals strong changes between rainforest and open woodland vegetation. The Holocene portion of the record shows a stepwise vegetation development, from dry conditions in the early Holocene, to high lake levels and increasing forest between 5.5 and 3 cal kyr BP. At 3--2 cal kyr BP, a large diversification occurred towards the present-day heterogeneous sub-tropical rainforest vegetation, followed by a small rainforest decline at 0.45 cal kyr BP. Additionally, charcoal analysis indicates increases in fire occurrence contemporaneously with periods of drier vegetation and/or low lake levels. Part of the reconstructed vegetation changes can be related to local and regional factors including forest succession, dune formation, sea-level rise and human impact. Comparison with paleoclimate records from tropical and temperate regions indicates that the temporal and spatial dynamics of vegetation changes in eastern Australia are primarily controlled by climate variability. Particularly the increasing activity of the El Niño--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the late Holocene caused greater climate variability in eastern Australia, resulting in more heterogenous vegetation cover.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Dongen:2019size,"Concentrations of in-situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be in river sediment are widely used to estimate catchment-average denudation rates. Typically, the 10Be concentrations are measured in the sand fraction of river sediment. However, the grain size of bedload sediment in most bedrock rivers covers a much wider range. Where 10Be concentrations depend on grain size, denudation rate estimates based on the sand fraction alone are potentially biased. To date, knowledge about catchment attributes that may induce grain-size-dependent 10Be concentrations is incomplete or has only been investigated in modelling studies. Here we present an empirical study on the occurrence of grain-size-dependent 10Be concentrations and the potential controls of hillslope angle, precipitation, lithology, and abrasion. We first conducted a study focusing on the sole effect of precipitation in four granitic catchments located on a climate gradient in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera. We found that observed grain size dependencies of 10Be concentrations in the most-arid and most-humid catchments could be explained by the effect of precipitation on both the scouring depth of erosion processes and the depth of the mixed soil layer. Analysis of a global dataset of published 10Be concentrations in different grain sizes (n=73 catchments) – comprising catchments with contrasting hillslope angles, climate, lithology, and catchment size – revealed a similar pattern ...

The Model is tested against the Pandanus nut remains from the sites. The test concludes that the morphological differences between the Pandanus nuts are not a result of the domestication process but probably represent the habitat preference of the Pandanus species.

Dortch:2004wallaby,"Quaternary vertebrate extinctions attract wide interest because of the role ascribed to humans as agents of extinction, through either over-hunting or altering habitat. This paper examines faunal and floral records from the archaeological site at Tunnel Cave, Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region, southwestern Australia, which are relevant to the Mid-Holocene local extinction of Black-flanked Rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis). Possible factors causing the population decline include inter-species competition, over-hunting by humans or other predators, or vegetation habitat change caused by climate change or changes in human firing practices. Identification of macroscopic charcoal excavated at Tunnel Cave shows that changes in canopy trees began from 10,000 BP, consistent with post-glacial rainfall increases, and probably causing the encroachment of closed habitats and loss of grazing areas. These changes are consistent with other faunal shifts at Tunnel Cave and with faunal and identified charcoal records from the nearby Devil‘s Lair deposit. There is little evidence for changes in competitor or predator behaviour, although increasing geographic isolation of Petrogale habitats possibly exacerbated predator impacts. The timing of human occupations at Tunnel Cave in relation to vegetation change suggests that human firing was a minor influence on forest composition or structure. Petrogale‘s Mid-Holocene disappearance from the region is therefore attributable to climatically driven encroachment of closed habitat.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Dortch:2010subsistence,"Palaeo-environments and past human subsistence patterns are difficult to determine from dual-patterned faunal assemblages where human and non-human predators have accumulated and intensively modified animal bones. This paper examines such records in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Region of south-western Australia, where a thin belt of coastal limestone contains caves and rock shelters with rich faunal deposits. The Late Pleistocene and Holocene part of this record derives from four archaeological sites: Devil's Lair, Tunnel Cave, Witchcliffe Rock Shelter and Rainbow Cave. Correspondence analysis combined with cluster analysis enables a preliminary assessment of habitat changes using simple species abundances in the faunal assemblages and comparison with indices of past human activity in the sites and the species' present habitat preferences. These inferred changes, consistent with previous analyses of faunal remains and tree charcoal, suggest that late Holocene sites document Aboriginal occupation in coastal heath, scrub and woodland. Late Pleistocene deposits record hinterland occupation at times of low sea-level when the coast was up to 30km seawards of its present position and the surrounding vegetation was open-forest or woodland. As rainfall increased and vegetation changed in the Holocene, species foraging in open-woodland declined or became locally extinct, while species requiring closed canopy habitats increased. Rank-order correlations of taxa and archaeological remains from depositional sequences before and after the environmental change indicate that the occupiers of late Holocene sites favoured the same generalist species that occupiers of Late Pleistocene sites had favoured, which were available at all times. Prey habitats, foraging behaviours and historic records of ethnographic hunting and settlement pattern suggest that this local continuity is consistent with maintenance of a 'dispersive mode' subsistence pattern in the region.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dortch:2011ladakh,"Variations in erosion were quantified across the topographically and morphometrically asymmetrical central Ladakh Range in NW India to elucidate erosion and sediment transfer processes across space and time and to gain insight into how mountains erode and evolve. Morphometric analysis and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide analysis of 14 fluvial sediment samples from active channels in six catchments conducted across the mountain range constrains 100 ka timescale erosion rates for catchments on the northern side of the mountain range and are between 56 ± 12 and 74 ± 11 m/Ma, while catchments on the southern side of the mountain range to between 20 ± 3 and 39 ± 8 m/Ma for the last ~ 300 ka. Maximum elevation from swath analysis across the range shows a strong correlation with the ELAs of 382 contemporary glaciers. The higher erosion rate to the north likely relates to tectonic tilting of the central Ladakh Range and to active rock uplift on the northern side of the range along the Karakoram Fault. Morphometric analysis shows that the maximum and average elevations increase at nearly the same rate on a catchment-scale across the central Ladakh Range, with higher elevation on the northern side. This suggests that greater erosion on the northern side of the range is not keeping pace with rock uplift. Moreover, long-term denudational unloading does not play a significant role in the tectonic tilting of the central Ladakh Range.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Dortch:2016lancefield,"Lancefield Swamp, south-eastern Australia, was one of the earliest sites to provoke interest in Pleistocene faunal extinctions in Sahul (Pleistocene Australia-New Guinea). The systematic investigation of the deposit in the early 1970s identified megafaunal remains dominated by the 100-200~kg kangaroo Macropus giganteus titan. Associated radiocarbon ages indicated that the species was extant until c.30,000~BP, suggesting significant overlap with human settlement of Sahul. This evidence was inconsistent with contemporary models of rapid human-driven extinctions. Instead, researchers inferred ecological tethering of fauna at Lancefield Swamp due to intense drought precipitated localised mass deaths, consistent with Late Pleistocene climatic variability. Later investigations in another part of the swamp, the Mayne Site, remote to the initial investigations, concluded that mass flow disturbed this area, and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses on megafauna teeth returned wide-ranging ages. To clarify site formation processes and dating of Lancefield Swamp, we excavated new test-pits next to previous trenches in the Classic and Mayne Sites. We compared absolute chronologies for sediments and teeth, sedimentology, palaeo-topography, taphonomy, and macropod age at death across the swamp. Luminescence dating of sediments and ESR analysis of teeth returned ages between c.80,000 and 45,000 years ago. We found no archaeological remains in the bone beds, and evidence of carnivore activity and fluvial action, in the form of reactivated spring flow. The latter disturbed limited parts of the site and substantial areas of the bone beds remained intact. The faunal assemblage is dominated by megafaunal adult Macropus, consistent with mass die-offs due to severe drought. Such droughts appear to have recurred over millennia during the climatic variability of Marine Isotope Stages 4 and 3. These events began tens of millennia before the first appearance of Aboriginal people in Sahul and only the very youngest fossil deposits could be coeval with the earliest human arrivals. Therefore, anthropogenic causes cannot be implicated in most if not all of mass deaths at the site. Climatic and environmental changes were the main factors in site formation and megafauna deaths at Lancefield Swamp.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Douglass:2021cassowary,"How early human foragers impacted insular forests is a topic with implications across multiple disciplines, including resource management. Paradoxically, terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene impacts of foraging communities have been characterized as both extreme—as in debates over human-driven faunal extinctions—and minimal compared to later landscape transformations by farmers and herders. We investigated how rainforest hunter-gatherers managed resources in montane New Guinea and present some of the earliest documentation of Late Pleistocene through mid-Holocene exploitation of cassowaries (Aves: Casuariidae). Worldwide, most insular ratites were extirpated by the Late Holocene, following human arrivals, including elephant birds of Madagascar (Aepyornithidae) and moa of Aotearoa/New Zealand (Dinornithiformes)—icons of anthropogenic island devastation. Cassowaries are exceptional, however, with populations persisting in New Guinea and Australia. Little is known of past human exploitation and what factors contributed to their survival. We present a method for inferring past human interaction with mega-avifauna via analysis of microstructural features of archaeological eggshell. We then contextualize cassowary hunting and egg harvesting by montane foragers and discuss the implications of human exploitation. Our data suggest cassowary egg harvesting may have been more common than the harvesting of adults. Furthermore, our analysis of cassowary eggshell microstructural variation reveals a distinct pattern of harvesting eggs in late ontogenetic stages. Harvesting eggs in later stages of embryonic growth may reflect human dietary preferences and foraging seasonality, but the observed pattern also supports the possibility that—as early as the Late Pleistocene—people were collecting eggs in order to hatch and rear cassowary chicks.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Downie:2011terra,"Soils developed on the sites of Australian Aboriginal oven mounds along the Murray River in SE Australia, classified as Cumulic Anthroposols under the Australian Soil Classification, are shown to have traits similar to the Terra Preta de Indio of the Amazon basin. Seven such sites were characterised and compared with adjacent soils. The Cumulic Anthroposols contained significantly (p < 0.05) more soil carbon (C), compared to adjacent non-Anthroposols. Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy showed that the C in the Cumulic Anthroposols was predominantly aromatic, especially at depth, confirming the presence of charcoal. Radiocarbon analysis carried out on charcoal collected from two of these sites showed that it was deposited 650±30 years BP at one site and 1609±34 years BP at the other site, demonstrating its recalcitrance in soil. The charcoal originated from plant material, as shown by SEM, and had high levels of Ca agglomeration on its surfaces. The Cumulic Anthroposols were shown to have altered nutrient status, with total N, P, K and Ca being significantly greater than in the adjacent soils throughout the profile. This was also reflected in the higher mean CEC of 31.2 cmol (+) kg‚àí1 and higher pH by 1.3 units, compared to the adjacent soils. Based on the similarity of these Cumulic Anthroposols with the Terra Preta de Indio of the Amazon, we suggest that these Cumulic Anthroposols can be classified as Terra Preta Australis. The existence of these soils demonstrates that Australian soils, in temperate climates, are capable of storing C in much higher quantities than has been previously recognised, and that this capability is founded on the unique stability and properties of charred organic matter. Furthermore, the addition of charcoal appears to have improved the physical and chemical properties of these soils. Together, this provides important support for the concept of soil amendment with ‘biochar‘, the charred residue produced by pyrolysis of biomass, as a means for sequestering C and enhancing agricultural productivity.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Doyle:2003nambucca,"The Nambucca River catchment is on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia, and drains 1,407 km2 of land east of the Great Dividing Range. This study examines the pre- and post-settlement record of channel change in the seven tributaries of the Nambucca catchment and suggests a scheme for rehabilitation based on current geomorphic information and the identified record of channel changes. The Late Pleistocene history, obtained from 19 river terrace thermoluminescence dates, identifies a remnant terrace of 78 ka from the Colleambally Phase during Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5. Younger terraces correspond to the Kerarbury Phase (55-35 ka) and the Gum Creek Phase (31-25 ka), both in OIS 3. However, the majority of terraces date during the Yanco Phase (20-13 ka) in OIS 2. This record of late Quaternary activity correlates with periods of fluvial activity identified on the much larger Nepean and Murrumbidgee Rivers in southeastern Australia. No sediment dates have been obtained in the Nambucca catchment for the period 12 ka to 3 ka, probably because extensive flushing removed most of that alluvium in what has recently been termed the Nambucca Phase. Radiocarbon dating of the Nambucca floodplains has provided 15 dates, all but one younger than 3000 yrBP. Between 3000 and 2500 yrBP, the streams changed from gravel, braided and somewhat laterally active, to stable systems forming floodplains by vertical accretion and with channels that underwent occasional avulsion. This laterally stable period continued through to European settlement in the middle 1800's. Since settlement there have been four periods of change in the catchment that have shaped the formation of the streams in the catchment: Phase 1 (1830-1870): Settlers selectively logged the forested catchments for red cedar (Toona australis) but during this phase much of the forest on stream banks and floodplains remained intact. Phase 2 (1870-1896): Extensive land clearance for agriculture occurred during this phase. A cluster of large floods in the 1890's triggered a series of nickpoints. The initial channel instability problems probably date to this period. Phase 3 (1897-1947): The period from the late 1890's to the late 1940's was relatively dry with very few recorded flood events. However, the earliest available aerial photographs from 1942 indicate channels straightened with meanders having cut-offs in the lower part of the catchment.

Small patches of varnish on secondary carbonate, on non-varnished rock and sometimes on existing varnish suggest that current environmental conditions allow for some varnish formation.

Draper:1987couedic,"Lying within sight of the South Australian mainland, the 4000km2 land mass of Kangaroo Island presents a continuing archaeological mystery. In the mythology of southern coastal Aborigines, it was Karta - island of the dead (Tindale and Maegraith 1931; Berndt 1940) - a spirit place beyond the reach of living people. However, reports of the discovery of stone artefacts on the island by Howchin in 1903 and Tindale and Maegraith in 1931 demonstrated that Aboriginal people once had occupied the island, beyond the recollection of oral history. The suite of stone implements recorded by Tindale was distinctive. It consisted primarily of large, unifacially-flaked cobble choppers, unidirectional block cores (‘horsehoofs‘ and ‘karta‘), steep-edged, thick flake tools, pitted hammerstones, occasional massive ‘waisted axes‘ - and very few flakes. Most artefacts were made from the island‘s abundant quartzites and metasandstones, with occasional use of quartz. This assemblage was unlike any stage of the industrial sequence identified at Devon Downs rocksheiter (Hale and Tindale 1930). Tindale named the Kangaroo Island industry the ‘Kartan culture‘. Scattered finds of similar implements had been made in the Flinders Ranges north of Adelaide, and along the Fleurieu Peninsula to the south. This suggested to Tindale that the Kartan might date to the last ice age, when Kangaroo Island was connected to the mainland through lowered sea levels. Tindale also recognised similar implements in collections of artefacts from Tasmania. The location of Kartan artefacts on relict, stranded shorelines around Murray Lagoon reinforced the idea of Pleistocene antiquity, as did the similarity of the cobble artefacts to examples from Sumatra and Malaya, which were thought to date to the Upper Pleistocene. Putting all of these clues together, Tindale (1937:59) suggested that the Kartan artefacts represented the toolkit of the earliest immigrants to Australia from southeast Asia _ the people who had reached Tasmania and Kangaroo Island while these places were accessible by glacial land bridge. Consequently, Tindale placed the Kartan as the earliest phase of the industrial succession which he described for Australian prehistory (Tindale 1957, 1968, 1981).",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Duller:1997dunes,"Northern Tasmania has a geographically extensive cover of Quaternary aeolian features and although the morphology and stratigraphy of many of these have been studied it is difficult to assign a reliable chronology because of the lack of material suitable for radiocarbon dating. The dunes are primarily composed of quartz and hence are ideally suited for the application of luminescence dating. In this paper a variety of luminescence techniques are applied to samples from the area. Analysis of the multiple aliquot OSL measurements showed that a higher precision could be obtained using the signal from the initial 6 mJ.cm−2 of the optical stimulation rather than the total light sum. The initial, near exponential. decay of the OSL signal is highly reproducible from one sub-sample to another, but the later part of the OSL decay curve, which is dominated by retrapping effects, is highly variable. The multiple aliquot OSL results are consistent with single aliquot additive dose results. The luminescence ages show that the Ainslie Linear Dunes were initially deposited by 44 ka, were mobile again at 30 ka and have been subject to reworking within the last 100–200 years. It appears that the Quaternary history of aeolian activity in this area has been more complex than was previously thought.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Duller:2006reassessment,"Stabilized linear dunes in northeastern Tasmania have previously been dated using luminescence signals from quartz (Duller G.A.T, Augustinus, P., 1997 Luminescence studies of dunes from north-eastern Tasmania. Quaternary Geochronology (QSR) 16, 357-365.) and gave ages from 44±4 to 29±3ka. Unexpectedly, no evidence was found for dune activity at the last glacial maximum (LGM). The ages were obtained using analytical methods available at the time, including multiple aliquot methods. In recent years the single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) procedure has been developed, and this method gave ages from 23.8±1.6 to 21.8±1.3ka for the same samples. A further seven samples from other linear dunes in the area gave ages from 16.8 to 19.7ka. These ages are strong evidence that linear dunes in northeastern Tasmania were last active at, or immediately after, the LGM, consistent with evidence for enhanced aridity through large parts of the Australian continent at that time. Earlier methods of optical dating using quartz did not explicitly check for changes in luminescence sensitivity and thus their reliability must be suspect. For samples measured here, the largest discrepancy in equivalent dose between the sensitivity corrected and non-sensitivity corrected data is 84%, while for the remainder it is much smaller. These results demonstrate the importance of checking the validity of previously published optical dating results which were obtained using methods that did not explicitly check for sensitivity change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Dunlop:2017dietary,"The endangered northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) is a predatory marsupial with a wide and disjointed distribution across northern Australia. The disjunct Pilbara population occurs in a uniquely arid area, and faces different threatening processes to populations elsewhere. To better understand the ecology of this small carnivore, we undertook a dietary analysis of 498 scats collected across ~100,000 km2. We calculated dietary composition and niche breadth and modeled these against biogeophysical factors (latitude, longitude, rainfall, elevation, and distance to coast) for 10 study landscapes. We also conducted pairwise comparisons of diet groups to evaluate regional dietary differences. Quolls were highly omnivorous, consuming at least 23 species of vertebrates (mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs), as well as arthropods, molluscs, fruit, and carrion. Diet varied widely across the region, with up to 3-fold differences in dietary niche breadth between study landscapes. We found few clear environmental drivers of the diet of D. hallucatus. The most frequently consumed food type was insects, but their occurrence in diets decreased as that of rodents and vegetation increased, indicating potential dietary preferences. The broad and variable diet of D. hallucatus indicates opportunism similar to that of other small carnivores. Given this broad dietary niche, conservation managers will need a priori knowledge of local prey abundance if they are to accurately predict the composition of D. hallucatus diets.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,

Dury:1973pluvial,"Some internally draining lakes in northwestern New South Wales, Australia, are contained in structural basins but owe their lack of external outlets to arid climate. Former high lake shorelines are defined in part by precipitated crusts or by deltas. Radiocarbon dating, although as yet less than satisfactory, suggests that the high lake stands occurred not later than about 14,500 B.P. They may eventually be correlated with lacustrine episodes that, elsewhere in inland New South Wales, occurred in the range 23,500 to 15,500 B.P. Whether or not the lakes under discussion existed at the time of maximum cold is uncertain; but they were indubitably associated with low paleotemperatures. Reconstruction of former temperatures involves little or no controversy. Use of paleotemperatures to reconstruct former evaporation rates produces results that stand up well to checking. Manipulation of the equilibrium equations for closed lakes produces precipitation equations that involve evaporation, area ratio between lake and rest of basin, and √©vapotranspiration. Empirical studies and some paleohydrologic work supply values or ranges of √©vapotranspiration and basin loss. Even in the lowest observed or estimated range of √©vapotranspiration, the precipitation equations indicate former precipitation about 50 percent greater than that of today. Calculation of √©vapotranspiration rates for former conditions of radiation and temperature and for a range of sunshine incidence, and entry of these rates into the precipitation equations, show that very low values of sunshine incidence would be required to drive calculated precipitation down to, or below, today‘s levels. That is to say, any hypothesis that the former high lake stands were associated with reduced precipitation demands inordinately low rates of √©vapotranspiration, plus a combination of reduced precipitation with inordinately high cloudiness.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Edney:1990wangoom,"Pollen, microfaunal and sedimentological evidence from the top 20 m of sediment in a closed volcanic crater lake is used to construct a detailed record of vegetation and environmental conditions through the Holocene and a substantial part of the Late Pleistocene. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the sequence covers tha last 51,000 yr or so. High lake-levels and the presence of forest or woodland vegetation indicate that the Holocene and the basal few thousand years of the record experienced wet and warm conditions. The earliest period was succeeded by a long phase of lower but variable moisture levels before more arid conditions resulted in the replacement of forest and woodland by herbaceous vegetation and frequent lake drying. Periods of slight amelioration occurred between about 27,000 and 19,000 and before 15,000 radiocarbon yr ago. Maximum aridity occurred between about 19,000 and 10,000 yr B.P., a period incorporating the height of the last glacial. During the Pleistocene, the lake became gradually more saline but has been fresh during the Holocene, even under low lake-levels. An increase in charcoal values is recorded, probably around 20,000 years ago, and this could have resulted from increased burning as a result of the activities of Aboriginal people. This may have also caused a change in understorey vegetation from one composed largely of Asteraceae, to grassland. The record is compared with others from southeastern Australia and there is good correspondence through the last 20,000 or 30,000 yr but, before this, problems of dating and the condensed nature of most sequences prevent detailed correlation.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

The Lagoon held permanent water during the late LGM and early deglaciation but was intermittently dry during the late deglaciation. During the late LGM, local vegetation was dominated by a sub-alpine herbfield but the significant presence of rainforest taxa in the pollen record indicates the survival of rainforest, rainforest margin or wet sclerophyll communities close to the site. By ca. 17 000 cal a BP, open Eucalyptus forest replaced the alpine herbfield vegetation indicating that warming had commenced. Rainforest taxa disappeared at this time but reappeared at the end of the deglaciation. The LGM conditions are consistent with a dominant circulation system whereby persistent high pressure over eastern Australia brings onshore easterlies to this region and maintains humid conditions along the east coast and highlands of the Great Dividing Range. This is similar to modern winter circulation but the persistence of rainforest and wet sclerophyll taxa suggests an increase in easterly flow over modern conditions during the LGM.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Ellerton:2018blowout,"Cliff-top dunes are a locally important geomorphic features of sedimentary coasts. They are traditionally interpreted as being sourced by (or with) sand derived from the beach below the cliff. This paper presents the results of a stratigraphic and geochronological study of Carlo Sand Blow, a coastal blowout that has developed on top of a high sandy cliff in the Cooloola Sand Mass, south-east Queensland. We use a combination of sedimentological, pedological and geophysical techniques along with optically stimulated luminescence dating to determine the depositional history and evolution of the blowout. We demonstrate that the blowout is dominantly nourished by sand eroded from its floor rather than the adjacent beach. The original dune surface dates to the first half of the last glacial period (c. 40-70 ka) and this dune was deflated in the late-Holocene. Dune activity is directly associated with cliff undercutting because of coastal retreat in the late-Holocene, but coastal erosion on its own is not capable of maintaining aeolian activity. Blowout activity occurred between 2.6 and 2.3 ka and again at 0.3 ka with aeolian sand burying palaeosols. Both soil surfaces contained charcoal and tree stumps in growth position and our study suggests that fire is the immediate trigger for blowout reactivation. It is likely that these fires were anthropogenic in origin, because the site is somewhat protected from natural fire and the ages coincide with intensification of human use of coastal sites in the area.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Geomorphic and chronostratigraphic analyses have identified seven major periods of dune activity with the earliest phase of deposition occurring ca. 800 ka.

Here we use optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating to constrain the formation of the extensive dunes that make up Fraser Island, the world's largest sand island, and adjacent Cooloola Sand Mass in southeastern Queensland. We find that both formed between 1.2 Ma and 0.7 Ma, during a global climate reconfiguration across the Middle Pleistocene transition. They formed as a direct result of increased amplitude of sea-level fluctuations associated with increasing global ice volume that redistributed previously stored sediment across the continental shelf. The development of Fraser Island dramatically reduced sediment supply to the continental shelf north of the island. This facilitated widespread coral reef formation in the southern and central Great Barrier Reef and was a necessary precondition for its development.

Climate was cooler and drier than at present. From ca. 3400 BP, warmth-loving species such as A. australis and drought-intolerant species, Dacrydium cupressinum and Ascarina lucida, became common, implying a warm and moist climate. The pollen record also suggests a windier climate. The most significant event in the record, however, occurred after ca. 900 BP (800 cal BP) when anthropogenic deforestation commenced. A dramatic decline in forest taxa followed, accompanied by the establishment of a Pteridium-esculentum-dominated community. Fire almost certainly caused this, evidenced by a dramatic increase of charcoal.

Elliot:1997thesis,"Sediments from 3 peat mires and two lakes from the Aupouri Peninsula, Karikari Peninsula and the Bay of Islands district of Northland, New Zealand, are analysed for their pollen and charcoal records to reconstruct a 100,000-year late Quaternary history of vegetational and climatic change. Northland has a complex geological history which includes Upper Pleistocene to Holocene volcanism. The region has a warm, moist climate, which promotes deep weathering of rocks, clay-rich soils and mass movement, particularly in the period following human settlement with clearance of most of the natural rainforest. Throughout the Pleistocene the climate of Northland remained relatively mild in comparison to the more southern regions of New Zealand. This thesis determines how the far northern vegetational cover and its composition have changed in response to late Quaternary climate changes through detailed pollen analysis of sediment cores. Studies of recent pollen deposits were undertaken to provide analogues for interpretation of the relationship between pollen rain and plant communities. Because New Zealand is one of the few land masses in the southern hemisphere south of 35° S, and lies just poleward of the subtropical convergence, it is uniquely placed to record climatic changes in the vast expanse of the Southern Ocean. These records of climatic fluctuations have global importance because of 1) New Zealand's small size and remoteness from other land masses, 2) the lack of large ice sheets at the Last Glacial Maximum which ensured rapid vegetational response to ameliorating climate, and 3) the potential for correlating high-resolution, well-dated terrestrial and marine records. At the height of the Last Glacial (Otiran) most of New Zealand south of 37° S was unforested. Landscapes not directly affected by glaciation were largely dominated by grass and shrublands. Forest patches survived in microclimatically favoured locations where they were protected from heavy frosts, cold maritime polar airmasses and strong winds. During the ca 100,000 years investigated, the pollen profiles demonstrate that the Northland region retained permanent forest cover, although composition of far northern forests changed significantly in response to fluctuating weather patterns. These vegetational and climatic changes are summarised below: 1) Kaihinu Interglacial, 18O Sub-stage 5c-a, ca 100-74 ka The regional vegetation of far northern New Zealand was dominated by kauri-podocarp-hardwood forest. The most important tall trees were Agathis australis, Dacrydium cupressinum and Phyllocladus. Ascarina lucida, a small, frost- and drought-sensitive understorey tree, was common. Angiosperm trees dominated coastal forest. The commonest species were Beilschmiedia, Quintinia, Metrosideros, Nestegis, Elaeocarpus and Ixerba brexioides. The climate is interpreted as having been mild and moist. Temperatures may have been 1-2° C cooler than present. 2) Last Glacial (Otiran), 18O Stages 4-2, ca 74-14 ka Regional vegetation changed significantly during the Otiran Glaciation. Whilst the far northern forests remained predominantly diverse conifer-hardwood assemblages, warmth-loving species became increasingly restricted in their distribution, particularly Ascarina lucida. From ca 74 ka, Agathis australis became scarce in the Kaitaia area, but remained a significant element of regional forest further east. Dacrydium cupressinum was a common emergent tree. Between 74-59 ka, climates were generally cool and moist with increased incidence of winter frost in exposed areas. Lowland forests moved seaward to occupy newly exposed continental margins as sea level retreated consequent upon expansion of global ice caps. The following period from 59-43 ka was characterised by increased abundance of Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Metrosideros species, Quintinia and Syzygium maire. These species are associated with wetter conditions. Ascarina lucida was also more common at this time. Regional forests were predominantly podocarp-hardwood assemblages. Agathis australis was present in these forests, but not dominant. ... [_truncated_]",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Also of particular importance at this time is the dramatic rise in the curve for Ptendium esculentum (bracken), which is associated with Polynesian land clearance and cultivation The date for forest clearance is much later than the widely accepted date of ca 1000 yr BP for first settlement. Sedimentological evidence, in particular changes in grain-size distribution, supports palynological inferences of anthropogenic disturbance of local vegetation and associated soil instability Increased rates of erosion are indicated by sharp rises in coarse grainsize fractions from ca 700 yr BP These granulometric trends are accompanied by changes in sediment chemistry, especially potassium and sodium, which show increased concentrations.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Elliot:1998kaitaia,"A vegetational history and palaeoclimatic changes are established for the last 25,000 yr by pollen analysis of two peat cores from Kaitaia Bog, far northern New Zealand. Twelve AMS radiocarbon dates provide a chronology covering the Last Glacial Maximum to the late Holocene, ca. 2500 yr ago. Prior to 22,000 yr B.P. a tall, complex, conifer-beech-hardwood forest dominated by podocarp trees covered the region. The most abundant of these was Dacrydium cupressinum. Nothofagus (N. cf. truncata) was also an important element. Other common emergent trees included Podocarpus, Prumnopitys ferruginea, P. taxifolia, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Libocedrus and Metrosideros. From 22,000 to ca. 14,000 yr B.P. regional forest was dominated by Nothofagus cf. truncata, and warm, moist elements such as Ascarina lucida and Agathis australis were scarce. This Last Glacial Maximum forest cover contrasts with the open grass and shrub communities which dominated landscapes south of Auckland. Cool climate species such as Nothofagus cf. truncata began to decline towards the end of the Lateglacial, and from ca. 11,300 yr B.P. Ascarina lucida started to increase rapidly. Replacement of conifer-beech-hardwood forest with a conifer-hardwood association proceeded rapidly in the Postglacial as Nothofagus cf. truncata retracted sharply and Dacrydium cupressinum increased in abundance. The regional expansion of Agathis australis followed rapidly. Regional forest in the mid- to late Holocene consisted of a conifer-hardwood association dominated by Dacrydium cupressinum, Podocarpus, Phyllocladus and Agathis australis. A mid-Holocene decline for Ascarina lucida and coincident increased abundance of Prumnopitys taxifolia suggest somewhat cooler conditions prevailed from this time. Nothofagus cf. truncata, though still present, assumed only a minor role as more favourable conditions allowed other species a competitive advantage.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Elliot:1998tauanui,"Late Holocene pollen and sediment records from the Lake Tauanui catchment, northern New Zealand, indicate that the lake formed about 5500 years ago following a series of volcanic events in the Tauanui Volcanic Centre. These volcanic events initiated a volcanosere resulting in a mixed conifer-hardwood forest. Dacrydium cupressinum was the dominant tree. Agathis australis was always present. Changes similar to those registered in other Northland pollen diagrams are apparent. At ca 4000 yr B.P., when the climate became cooler and drier than before, a fire occurred in the catchment area causing erosion of the surrounding slopes and some destruction of forest. Fluctuations in abundance of many forest species, including Ascarina lucida, A. australis and D. cupressinum, from ca 3500 yr B.P. indicate repeated disturbance, increasingly so after 1600 yr B.P. Summer droughts and increased frequency of cyclonic winds are suggested as the cause. Major anthropogenic deforestation events defined by palynology occurred across many parts of the New Zealand landscape at ca 700 yr B.P. At Lake Tauanui anthropogenic forest disturbance, radiocarbon dated to ca 1000 yr B.P., is indicated by significant decline in all tree and shrub elements with concomitant increase in pteridophytes, especially Pteridium esculentum. Charcoal concentration increases steadily from the onset of disturbance, and in the final phase after the arrival of Europeans, major clearance of vegetation is indicated. Herbs increase markedly in this period, in diversity and abundance.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Elliot:2005tangonge,"Vegetation and climate changes during the Last Glacial through to the late Holocene are identified by pollen analysis of a core from Lake Tangonge in far northern New Zealand. During the earliest part of the record (> 50 ka), regional vegetation was dominated by podocarp-hardwood forest. The most important tall podocarp trees were Dacrydium cupressinum and Dacrycarpus dacrydioides. Knightia and Metrosideros sp. were common, and angiosperm elements dominated lowland/coastal forests. The cool, moist climates, of what may be equated to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, were followed by a much wetter and slightly warmer period during MIS 3b (59--43 ka) when Ascarina became more abundant along with Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Metrosideros sp., Quintinia and Syzygium maire. From ca. 43 to 24 ka (MIS 3a) Agathis australis-dominated, mixed, conifer--hardwood forest expanded and hardy podocarps, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifolia, became more abundant. Ascarina lucida was scarce. Climates characterised by drier summers and cooler winters became increasingly colder, drier and windier, particularly from ca. 30 ka. Replacement of Agathis australis--podocarp--hardwood forest with Fuscospora--podocarp--hardwood forest followed rapidly, and by the Last Glacial Maximum Northland forests as far north as ca. 35°S were dominated by Fuscospora. Bog vegetation burned frequently. Regional temperatures may have been depressed by as much as 3--3.5 °C below those of today, and rainfall was probably reduced by about two-thirds. Warm, moist elements expanded in the late glacial as the glacial-type flora became increasingly restricted. Changes in forest composition progressed even more rapidly from the onset of the Holocene. Across the far northern region, Fuscospora-dominated podocarp--hardwood forest was rapidly replaced by Agathis australis--podocarp--hardwood forest. Fuscospora declined sharply and Dacrydium cupressinum dominated regional forests. Hardy podocarps became less common than previously, and Ascarina reached its greatest abundance between ca. 10 and 7.6 ka. The early Holocene climate was probably the warmest and most equable for the past 100 ka and temperatures in the Kaitaia region may have been 1--2 °C warmer than present. The mid-to-late Holocene (5--2 ka) is characterised by the decline of Ascarina, and the increased abundance of Manoao colensoi, Podocarpus and Prumnopitys taxifolia. Climates were probably slightly cooler and drier during this time as a more seasonal, dry summer/wet, cool winter regime prevailed. Increased cyclonic activity is suggested during this time.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

A long period of generally wetter conditions during most of the Pleistocene is represented by thick uniform lacustrine clay beneath and near Lake Lewis. This is overlain by more heterogeneous lacustrine sediments deposited since hydrologic closure of the basin, which indicate fluctuating climatic conditions. OSL results show that dune building in the basin commenced before 95ka, when salinity at the depocentre was high. Dune building peaked around 23-21ka.

Although both the Te Werahi and Ponaki wetlands appear superficiallysimilar (both are dominated by raupo, Typha orientalis, and both are barriered by unvegetated coastal sands), radiocarbon dates show that they are of very different ages. The Te Werahi wetland shows organic sedimentation covering at least the last 3,700 years. This suggests it originated at the time that sea-level reached its present position around 6,500 years B.P. A sharp rise in the abundance of charcoal particles in sediments from the Te Werahi wetland indicates an increase in fire frequency between 2,620 and 2,150 years B.P. A phase of forest reduction, and destabilization of coastal sands, may date to this period. The Ponaki wetland has developed within the last 200--300 years. We argue that fire removed the vegetation and led to erosion of catchment soils and destabilization of coastal sands. Blocking of the stream outlet by a sand barrier probably accounts for subsequent wetland development or expansion. Pollen and sediment data support these conclusions.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Eriksson:2006naas,"Past phases of aggradation and incision have been studied along a 10 km reach in the Naas Valley in south-eastern Australia. Detailed mapping of the stratigraphy and an ambitious dating exercise, involving 23 optical dates, have been used to distinguish the different periods of aggradation and incision. The dated alluvial sequence shows that a period of aggradation occurred in the very late Pleistocene (ca. 14,000-12,000~years ago). Alluvial deposits are absent for the period 12,000-3300~years ago. Whether this truly reflects no deposition or a series of aggradation and erosion cycles remains unresolved. Aggradation dominated between 3300 and 900~years ago, punctuated by a short incision event around 1300~years ago. Gully erosion contemporaneous with this incision phase is also recorded. Incision has dominated during the last 900~years, cutting down to bedrock. This incision, which is still ongoing, has not been a continuous process, but involved short periods of aggradation. The exposed bedrock and large boulders display numerous scour holes indicating that bedrock has been exposed and abraided for lengthy periods in the past. The aggradation and incision cycles in the late Holocene gave rise to three groups of terraces, today visible along the study reach. Possible causes for the different periods of erosion and deposition are discussed in the context of late Pleistocene and Holocene climate change, land use impacts, and intrinsic factors.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Bedrock rivers are dynamic topographic features and a critical link between these processes, as they record and convey changes in tectonics, climate, and sea level across the landscape. River incision models, such as the stream power model, are often used to quantify the relationship between topography and rock motion in the context of landscapes at steady state. At steady state, the stream power model predicts higher denudation rates for steeper river channels, while accounting for only the vertical motion of rock due to rock uplift or denudation. However, natural landscapes often have more complicated histories, particularly in convergent orogens with asymmetric topography, where steady state requires that denudation must balance both vertical and horizontal rock motion. ...

Fagan:2001cooper,"This thesis is an investigation of the formation and distribution of the different channel patterns that co-exist on the broad, low-gradient floodplain surface of the Cooper Creek, an ephemeral, arid-zone river in south west Queensland, Australia. Although previous research described some aspects of the channel as being inherited from wetter Pleistocene periods, all the alluvial surface features were found to be consistent with a contemporary origin broadly in equilibrium with present environmental conditions. The anastomosing channel system is comprised of interconnected narrow and deep channels with resistant, cohesive boundaries. Levees are formed whose size is related to the size of the proximal channel, and their textural variations are more complex than the usual simple distal fining trends. Levee-like landforms are also formed by the deposition of sediment by flow converging on the channel from the floodplain surface. These forms were termed 'eevels' here to indicate that they form in the opposite way to levees, and there are textural differences between these forms and levees. The planform of anastomosing anabranches was analysed by both the direct measurement of channel planform and the fractal method and is consistent with that of freely meandering channels. Results suggest that the disruption of the channel boundary materials by wetting and drying cycles enables and determines bank erosion and channel migration, which seems to be greater in smaller channels due to greater fracturing of the boundaries of these channels. Smaller channels can be much more sinuous than larger channels and frequently form cutoffs. Elements of the extensive floodplain channel-system formed here interact with and influence the evolution of the larger, inset anastomosing channels. The angles of bifurcation junctions between anastomosing channels tend to be much larger than confluence angles, and a comparison with the angular geometry of junctions of braid-form or floodway channels and anastomosing channels suggests that the latter develop by the enlargement of floodways in a gradual avulsion process. Like the floodplain-surface channels here, the anastomosing channels form in response to high flows and their formation has the effect of increasing the efficiency of overbank flow transport by the floodplain. Reticulate and braid-form patterns cover more than 80% of the floodplain surface, and their distribution and occurrence at both the small and large scale is shown to be determined by overbank flow patterns. Flow patterns also influence the morphology of reticulate networks which have both transitive and space-filling aspects. Braidform channels co-occur with anastomosing",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Fairbanks:2005calibration,"Radiocarbon dating is the most widely used dating technique in the world. Recent advances in Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) and sample preparation techniques have reduced the sample-size requirements by a factor of 1000 and decreased the measurement time from weeks to minutes. Today, it is estimated that more than 90 percent of all measurements made on accelerator mass spectrometers are for radiocarbon age dates. The production of 14C in the atmosphere varies through time due to changes in the Earth's geomagnetic field intensity and in its concentration, which is regulated by the carbon cycle. As a result of these two variables, a radiocarbon age is not equivalent to a calendar age. Four decades of joint research by the dendrochronology and radiocarbon communities have produced a radiocarbon calibration data set of remarkable precision and accuracy extending from the present to approximately 12,000 calendar years before present. This paper presents high precision paired 230Th/234U/238U and 14C age determinations on pristine coral samples that enable us to extend the radiocarbon calibration curve from 12,000 to 50,000 years before present.

Falster:2018millennial,"Global climate variability during the late Quaternary is commonly investigated within the framework of the 'bipolar seesaw' pattern of asynchronous temperature variations in the northern and southern polar latitudes. The terrestrial hydrological response to this pattern in south-eastern Australia is not fully understood, as continuous, high-resolution, well-dated proxy records for the hydrological cycle in the region are sparse. Here we present a well-dated, highly resolved record of moisture balance spanning 30000--10000 calendar years before present (30--10 ka BP), based on x-ray fluorescence and organic carbon isotope (δ13COM) measurements of a sedimentary sequence from Lake Surprise in south-eastern Australia. The data provide a locally coherent record of the hydrological cycle. Elevated Si (reflecting windblown quartz and clays), and relatively high δ13COM, indicate an extended period of relative aridity between 28 and 18.5 ka BP, interrupted by millennial-scale episodes of decreased Si and δ13COM, suggesting increased moisture balance. This was followed by a rapid deglacial shift to low Si and δ13COM at 18.5 ka BP, indicative of wetter conditions. We find that these changes are coeval with other records from south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, and use a Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function approach to extract a common trend from three high-resolution records. Our analyses suggest that drivers of the regional hydrological cycle have varied on multi-millennial time scales, in response to major shifts in global atmosphere-ocean dynamics during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Southern Ocean processes were the dominant control on hydroclimate during glacial times, via a strong influence of cold sea surface temperatures on moisture uptake and delivery onshore. Following the last deglaciation (around 18 ka BP), the southward migration of cold Southern Ocean fronts likely resulted in the establishment of conditions more like those of the present day. Millennial-scale variability in records from the region is dominated by a persistent ca. 2300-year periodicity, consistent with other records across the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes; however, this pervasive periodicity is not obviously linked to the 'bipolar seesaw' and the mechanism remains equivocal.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Comparisons of 10Be concentrations between catchment-wide sediment (2.06 ± 0.34 × 104 to 11.24 ± 1.54 × 104 atoms g−1 SiO2; n = 33), near surface deposits (2.71 ± 0.33 × 104 to 3.48 ± 0.49 × 104 atoms g−1 SiO2; n = 6), 4-m-thick deep till (0.68 × 104 10Be atoms g−1 SiO2; n = 1), ridge bedrock (8.93 ± 0.47 × 104 to 34.05 ± 1.66 × 104 atoms g−1 SiO2; n = 20), and lower elevation polished bedrock (6.74 ± 0.67 × 104 to 12.65 ± 0.7 × 104 atoms g−1 SiO2, n = 5) indicate that most sand fluxing through catchments in the Scottish Highlands is sourced from the remobilization and vertical mixing of near surface deposits.

Fanning:1999arid,"Accelerated erosion by wind and water has taken place in arid western New South Wales, Australia, since the introduction of domestic and feral herbivores by Europeans in the nineteenth century. This action led to widespread soil loss by sheetwash, rilling, gullying, and aeolian deflation. Upland creek systems, formerly comprising shallow sinuous channels, are now entrenched into alluvial fills on the valley floor. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from Aboriginal cooking pits, exposed by this erosion, indicates that the current phase of incision of the valley floor has occurred since grazing of domestic animals began about 140 years ago. Stratigraphic evidence is presented which suggests that this type of incision (gullying or arroyo cutting in the valley floor) may not have occurred before within the 20,000 year sedimentary history of the valley fills studied. Channel enlargement and knickpoint retreat, initiated by these changes, is ongoing, and the implications of this for land and heritage management in the region are discussed. A conceptual model is presented which summarises the hydrogeomorphic changes which have occurred in upland catchments in the region as a result of changes in landcover.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The research combines new methods for documenting and analysing stone artefact scatters with an understanding of geomorphic landscape dynamics to seek insights into spatial and temporal patterns of Aboriginal occupation of the arid margin of Australia during the Late Holocene. The temporal dimension is dealt with in two ways: by radiocarbon determinations on charcoal from the remains of heat-retainer hearths associated with the artefact scatters, and by using optically simulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon determinations from valley fill sediments to develop a chronology of landscape evolution of the valleys in which the artefacts and hearths are found. The heat-retainer hearths produced a record of just less than 2000 years of activity within the valley of Stud Creek, a 30 square km catchment in Sturt National Park. ...

Fanning:2007framework,"We present data from Australian study areas that support episodic nonequilibrium as a suitable model for developing a theoretical and methodological framework for interpreting the surface archaeological record. According to this model, long periods of little or no geomorphic activity are punctuated by catastrophic events that erode or deposit sediments, and hence remove or cover up surface stone artefact deposits discarded by Indigenous people in the past. We demonstrate the impact of a single rainfall event on the surface archaeological record at one of our western New South Wales study locations. We then use the results of Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) of sediments underlying the artefact deposits and radiocarbon dating of associated heat-retainer hearths to suggest that both landscape chronology and the surface archaeological record are reflections of a series of episodic events such as this rain event. We conclude that, at least in our study area, the archaeological record is discontinuous in time because geomorphic events have removed the record equating to particular time periods. This process is cumulative so that the record of recent times is much more common when compared to that from earlier times. The episodic nature of geomorphic processes also has an effect on human behaviour, such that occupation of place is discontinuous. The methods by which the archaeological record is surveyed and interpreted need to take into account these spatial and temporal landscape discontinuities.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Fanning:2018mounds,"Large mounded deposits of shell are prominent archaeological features across much of the north Australian tropical coast. Many of the shell mounds are composed almost entirely of the bivalve Anadara granosa (Linnaeus 1758), a food source for Aboriginal people in the past. A relatively long history of inquiry into the nature and significance of the shell mounds has focussed primarily on analysing the shell component as clues to Australian Aboriginal coastal economies in the past. This paper presents results of new analyses on the non-shell sediments, examining the physical and chemical signatures of depositional and post-depositional processes within shell mounds near Weipa in far north Queensland, Australia, with a view to obtaining insights into how they formed and for what purposes, and how their morphology, structure and content may have changed since they ceased accumulating. We also consider how such changes might relate to past and present environmental conditions. Physical and chemical analyses indicate that the primary purpose of mound building was most likely to discard the large volumes of shell resulting from A. granosa harvesting and consumption. Post-depositional diagenetic alteration has strongly influenced the present day composition and form of the shell mounds, in particular the accession of carbon and silica to the mounds by environmental burning aided by strong leaching under the seasonal high rainfall conditions. As such the mound chemistry is more likely to reflect modern environmental conditions rather than provide an archive of, or an opening to, the past.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Fellin:2017taiwan,"We derive erosion rates from detrital zircon fission-track ages and cosmogenic nuclide concentrations from sediments from the modern rivers of eastern Taiwan in order to investigate how surface erosional processes vary in space and time across the young arc-continent collisional orogen of Taiwan. Taiwan is characterized by rapid rates of exhumation, a fluvial and landslide-dominated landscape, high seismicity, high relief and frequent typhoons. The obliquity between the convergence direction and the trend of the plate boundary provides a gradient in uplift and variations in longevity of orogenic activity with a young, immature orogen in the south, a mature orogen in central and northern Taiwan, and perhaps even the cessation of orogeny in the far north. The modern zircon fission-track detrital record is consistent with basement ages that show that much of the orogen is eroding at high rates with basin-wide mean zircon fission-track cooling ages as young as 0.9 Ma. The erosion rates derived from concentrations of cosmogenic nuclides (10Be) provide erosion rates averaged over much shorter timescales, but these two proxies provide estimates of erosion rates that are within error of each other across most of the collisional belt. Erosion rates are lowest in the immature zone of the orogen (< 1 km/Ma) in southern Taiwan, and increase to values ≥ 4 km/Ma in central Taiwan. Geomorphic indices, in particular channel steepness, are also correlated with erosion rates, suggesting that fluvial erosion is the dominant exhumation process and that landscape evolution is reacting primarily to tectonic forcing, fast enough to keep the landscape in a state of quasi-equilibrium where erosion rates and rock uplift rates are nearly equal. We find no measurable effects due to rock erodibility or precipitation rate, but if these parameters co-vary with tectonic uplift rate, our data could not resolve the influence of each.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Consequently, any feature of the stone artefact assemblages which might possibly be used as a temporal indicator is likely to draw considerable attention from archaeologists.

Ferrier:2005coast,"Comparing millennial‐scale denudation rates from cosmogenic nuclides with decadal‐scale sediment yields can shed light on erosional processes and on the effects of land use on sediment delivery to streams. Detailed measurements of sediment fluxes in the Northern California Coast Ranges at Caspar Creek and Redwood Creek have provided estimates of physical erosion rates since 1963 and 1971, respectively. We used cosmogenic 10Be to measure millennial‐scale denudation rates averaged over 1400–8700 years at six catchments in Caspar Creek and four catchments in Redwood Creek. Our 10Be measurements at Caspar Creek imply denudation rates that are nearly spatially uniform across the entire catchment and average 0·09 ± 0·02 mm a−1. These millennial‐scale rates implied by cosmogenic 10Be are faster than physical erosion rates of 0·005 ± 0·001 mm a−1 to 0·046 ± 0·007 mm a−1 inferred from sediment flux measurements over the past few decades in the same catchments. At Redwood Creek, our cosmogenic 10Be measurements imply millennial‐scale denudation rates that vary across the catchment from 0·14 ± 0·03 mm a−1 to 0·44 ± 0·09 mm a−1, in contrast to physical erosion rates ranging from 0·038 ± 0·011 mm a−1 to 0·48 ± 0·09 mm a−1 derived from sediment flux measurements made over the past few decades at the same catchments. The decadal‐scale and millennial‐scale measurements tend to differ most at the smallest tributaries, but differ by less than a factor of three for the Caspar Creek and Redwood Creek catchments as a whole. These measurements suggest that denudation rates at Caspar Creek are slower than rock uplift rates of 0·3–0·4 mm a−1, implying that Caspar Creek is not in topographic steady state.

Field:1999cuddie,"The Cuddie Springs site in south-eastern Australia provides the first evidence of an unequivocal association of megafauna with humans for this continent. Cuddie Springs has been known as a fossil megafauna locality for over a century, but its archaeological record has only recently been identified. Cuddie Springs is an open site, with the fossil deposits preserved in a claypan on the floor of an ancient ephemeral lake. Investigations revealed a stratified deposit of human occupation and fossil megafauna, suggesting a temporal overlap and an active association of megafauna with people in the lead up to the Last Glacial Maximum, when conditions were more arid than the present day. Two distinct occupation phases have been identified and are correlated to the hydrology of the Cuddie Springs lake. When people first arrived at Cuddie Springs, sometime before 30,000 BP, the claypan on the lake floor was similar to a waterhole, with five species of megafauna identified. Flaked stone artefacts were found scattered through this level. After the lake dried, there was human occupation of the claypan. The resource base broadened to include a range of plant foods. Megafauna appear to be just one of a range of food resources exploited during this period. A return to ephemeral conditions resulted in only periodic occupation of the site with megafauna disappearing from the record around 28,000 BP. The timing of overlap and association of megafauna with human occupation is coincident with the earliest occupation sites in this region. The archaeological evidence from Cuddie Springs suggests an opportunistic exploitation of resources and no specialised strategies for hunting megafauna. Disappearance of megafauna is likely to be a consequence of climatic change during the lead up to the Last Glacial Maximum and human activities may have compounded an extinction process well under way.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Field:2016starch,"The timing and nature of hunter-gather exploitation of tropical rainforests is a topic of ongoing debate. In contrast to most other tropical regions, permanent settlement in Australian rainforests developed much later, and in the absence of adjacent agricultural economies. Here we explore how the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland were exploited during the late Holocene through an ancient starch and phytolith record spanning the last 2000years. Sequences at the two sites under study - Urumbal Pocket (a 'Eucalyptus pocket' surrounded by rainforest) and Goddard Creek (within the rainforest) - indicate a human presence since the early Holocene, coincident with the re-establishment of rainforest in the region. Toxic starchy nuts and the associated complex processing underpinned permanent settlement. Using a geometric morphometric approach to starch analysis, a range of economic starch producing plant species were identified including Endiandra palmerstonii, E. insignis, Lasjia whelani and Beilschmiedia bancroftii in the Urumbal pocket sequence. The phytolith record shows that Urumbal Pocket has been a 'Eucalyptus pocket' for at least the last 2000years, the open nature of the vegetation maintained by regular burning. Goddard Creek, on the other hand has been closed forest, with a changing profile as fire was used more frequently over time.

Navigable pathways linking the north coast to the central cordillera, specifically ‘grassland corridors‘, may have facilitated settlement, yet little is known about human settlement of fringe montane valleys within these corridors.

Radiocarbon dating suggests a possible human presence from 31 ka, clear evidence for landscape use from 17 to 15 ka, and an increase in site density from the Mid-Holocene. Most sites were from open settings, with Holocene settlements positioned at elevations optimising access to montane forests, grasslands and lowland resources. We argue that the Simbai-Kaironk grassland corridor has facilitated access to the central Highland valleys since the Late Pleistocene. Shorter and more direct pathways, transecting the river valleys via prominent spurs rising above the lowlands - and their associated insect-borne diseases - are likely to have facilitated coastal-Highland movement throughout the Holocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Finnegan:2008namche,"Geodynamic modeling demonstrates the strong potential for erosion to influence the pattern and style of deformation in active mountain belts, but field studies yield conflicting views on the importance of erosion in influencing orogenesis. Here we compare patterns in river power, inferred excess fluvial-transport capacity, topographic relief, precipitation, and mineral-cooling ages to assess the coupling between surface erosion and rock uplift within the vicinity of the Namche Barwa–Gyala Peri massif, an active antiformal structure within the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Our rich and dense data set reveals a tight spatial correspondence of fluvial incision potential, high relief, and young cooling ages. The spatial coincidence is most easily explained by a sustained balance between rock uplift and denudation driven by river incision over at least the last ∼1 m.y. The Yarlung Tsangpo–Brahmaputra River is the largest and most powerful river in the Himalaya, and two lines of evidence point to its active role in the dynamic interaction of local erosion, rock uplift, thermal weakening of the lithosphere, and deformation: (1) Whereas along the rest of the Himalayan front, high relief and high rock uplift rates are essentially continuous, the high relief and rapid exhumation in the syntaxis is restricted to a “bull's-eye” pattern exactly where the largest river in the Himalaya, the Yarlung Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, has the most energy per unit area available to erode its channel and transport sediment. (2) The location of rapid incision on the Yarlung Tsangpo–Brahmaputra has been pinned for at least 1 m.y., and without compensatory uplift of the Namche Barwa–Gyala Peri massif during this time the river would have eroded headward rapidly, incising deeply into Tibet.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Fitzsimmons:2007frome,"Transverse and linear dunes near the ephemeral Lake Frome in the Strzelecki Desert of Australia provide evidence for a genetic geomorphic relationship between desert dune types. Transverse dunes, overlying palaeoshorelines, lie upwind from linear dunes. The sedimentology of both dune types is similar, suggesting reworking or downwind transport of the same source material over time. Clay pellets from several horizons within the linear and transverse dunes provide evidence for fluctuating water tables and high evaporation rates during those periods of aeolian activity, along with salt influx associated with the deflation of Lake Frome. We conclude that the nature and initiation of dune activity is controlled not only by aridity, but by local hydrology. OSL ages from both transverse and linear dunes indicate aeolian activity at 66–57 ka and 22–11 ka. Transverse dune building took place around 106–111 ka. Linear dune activity initiated at least 66 ka ago, with reactivation around 43–28 ka, followed by pedogenesis in response to humid conditions. Widespread dune reactivation from around 22 ka correlates broadly with the Last Glacial Maximum and late glacial period, consistent with evidence of cold, arid conditions and dune activity in Australia.

In this study, we collected 82 samples from 26 sites across the Strzelecki and Tirari Deserts in the driest part of central Australia to provide an optically stimulated luminescence chronology for these dunefields. The dunes preserve up to four stratigraphic horizons, bounded by palaeosols, which represent evidence for multiple periods of reactivation punctuated by episodes of increased environmental stability. Dune activity took place in episodes around 73-66, 35-32, 22-18 and 14-10ka. Intermittent partial mobilisation persisted at other times throughout the last 75ka and dune activity appears to have intensified during the late Holocene. Dune construction occurred when sediment was available for aeolian transport; in the Strzelecki and Tirari Deserts, this coincided with cold, arid conditions during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4, late MIS 3 and MIS 2, and the warm, dry climates of the late Pleistocene-Holocene transition period and late Holocene. Localised influxes of sediment on active floodplains and lake floors during the relatively more humid periods of MIS 5 also resulted in dune formation.

We present an optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology of recent lake shoreline sediments in order to reconstruct Holocene hydrologic variability at Lake George, providing past climatic context for the presently ephemeral lake conditions. The OSL chronology indicates three distinct periods of permanent lake conditions up to 15--18 m depth over the Holocene period, at approximately 10--8, 6--2.4 and 0.7--0.3 ka, with lower lake levels occurring in between those events.

Fitzsimmons:2012gregory,"Desert dunes within the monsoon-fed Gregory Lakes basin form valuable archives for Quaternary paleoenvironments, in a region where such records are scarce. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronologies from two dunes identify the timing of eolian processes, interpreted as a complex response to aridification and increased sediment availability during lake transgressions and associated fluvial activity. The earliest eolian deposition in our record occurred ca 91.5 ka, which postdates the last 'mega-lake' phase but predates a smaller lake transgression during early MIS 3. Sand plain accretion took place around ca 47 ka during contemporaneous periodic high lake levels. This was followed by intermittent linear dune building, between ca 35 and 11.5 ka, which most likely took place during an interval of relative aridity. Close spacing of mid-Holocene ages within one dune indicates rapid sediment accumulation in a single arid event ca 5 ka.

Fitzsimmons:2012naracoorte,"Southeastern South Australia, straddling the coastal zone and semi-arid desert margins of the lower Murray-Darling Basin, provides an important record of landscape response to past environmental change during the Pleistocene. Previous research in the region has focussed either on the coastal barrier systems, which formed during interglacial periods, or on the sub-parabolic and linear dune systems downwind, which generally formed under arid conditions out of phase with the strandlines. However, the geomorphologic and chronological relationship between these two systems is poorly understood. This study provides the first constraints on the initiation of dune development downwind of the Naracoorte East strandline. In this preliminary study we show that aeolian deposition at Naracoorte was constrained by sediment supply from the strandline upwind, and was most likely gradual, more or less continuous, and took place under relatively arid climatic regimes.

Fitzsimmons:2013change,"In this paper we synthesise existing palaeoenvironmental data from the arid and semi-arid interior of the Australian continent for the period 40–0 ka. Moisture is the predominant variable controlling environmental change in the arid zone. Landscapes in this region respond more noticeably to changes in precipitation than to temperature. Depending on their location, arid zone records broadly respond to tropical monsoon-influenced climate regimes, the temperate latitude westerly systems, or a combination of both. The timing and extent of relatively arid and humid phases vary across the continent, in particular between the westerly wind-controlled temperate latitudes, and the interior and north which are influenced by tropically sourced precipitation. Relatively humid phases in the Murray-Darling Basin on the semi-arid margins, which were characterised by large rivers most likely fed by snow melt, prevailed from 40 ka to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and from the deglacial to the mid Holocene. By contrast, the Lake Eyre basin in central Australia remained relatively dry throughout the last 40 ka, with lake high stands at Lake Frome around 35–30 ka, and parts of the deglacial period and the mid-Holocene. The LGM was characterised by widespread relative aridity and colder conditions, as evidenced by extensive desert dune activity and dust transport, lake level fall, and reduced but episodic fluvial activity. The climate of the deglacial period was spatially divergent. The southern part of the continent experienced a brief humid phase around ∼17–15 ka, followed by increased dune activity around ∼14–10 ka. This contrasts with the post-LGM persistence of arid conditions in the north, associated with a lapsed monsoon and reflected in lake level lows and reduced fluvial activity, followed by intensification of the monsoon and increasingly effective precipitation from ∼14 ka. Palaeoenvironmental change during the Holocene was also spatially variable. The early to mid-Holocene was, however, generally characterised by moderately humid conditions, demonstrated by lake level rise, source-bordering dune activity, and speleothem growth, persisting at different times across the continent.

Fitzsimmons:2015mungo,"The Willandra Lakes complex is one of the few locations in semi-arid Australia to preserve both paleoenvironmental and Paleolithic archeological archives at high resolution. The stratigraphy of transverse lunette dunes on the lakes' downwind margins record a late Quaternary sequence of wetting and drying. Within the Willandra system, the Lake Mungo lunette is best known for its preservation of the world's oldest known ritual burials, and high densities of archeological traces documenting human adaptation to changing environmental conditions over the last 45 ka. Here we identify evidence at Lake Mungo for a previously unrecognised short-lived, very high lake filling phase at 24 ka, just prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Mega-lake Mungo was up to 5 m deeper than preceding or subsequent lake full events and represented a lake volume increase of almost 250%. Lake Mungo was linked with neighboring Lake Leaghur at two overflow points, creating an island from the northern part of the Mungo lunette. This event was most likely caused by a pulse of high catchment rainfall and runoff, combined with neotectonic activity which may have warped the lake basin. It indicates a non-linear transition to more arid ice age conditions. The mega-lake restricted mobility for people living in the area, yet archeological traces indicate that humans rapidly adapted to the new conditions. People repeatedly visited the island, transporting stone tools across water and exploiting food resources stranded there. They either swam or used watercraft to facilitate access to the island and across the lake. Since there is no evidence for watercraft use in Australia between initial colonization of the continent prior to 45 ka and the mid-Holocene, repeated visits to the island may represent a resurrection of waterfaring technologies following a hiatus of at least 20 ky.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Fitzsimmons:2019lunettes,"The Willandra Lakes in semi-arid southeastern Australia provide some of the most continuous combined palaeoenvironmental and archaeological records on the continent. These are best preserved within the transverse shoreline (lunette) dunes on their downwind margins. Following final lake retreat c. 15 ka avulsion of the dominant fluvial inflow eastwards, the Willandra lunettes periodically reactivated, experiencing erosion, aeolian redeposition and alluvial sheetwash. These reworked sedimentary archives reflect regional climatic conditions rather than those of the entire catchment. Yet the focus of most study in the region to date has remained on the late Pleistocene. The general paucity of Holocene data has contributed to a perception that people largely abandoned the area in favour of the perennial Murray and Darling Rivers to the south and west. Our study reconstructs past geomorphological conditions and patterns of human mobility in adjacent Lakes Mungo and Durthong over the last c. 15 ka subsequent to final lake retreat, including the most recent 150?years since Europeans established pastoralism in the region. Our data show that Indigenous people did not abandon the area as previously assumed, but developed effective strategies for responding to the changed environmental conditions. Final lake retreat transitioned into a phase of aeolian accumulation c. 15?12 ka, indicating locally dry conditions. Subsequent aeolian reactivation peaked during arid phases experiencing less rainfall in the early Holocene and twice in the most recent 1000?years prior to European settlement in the area. Alluvial sheetwash was deposited onto lake floors during the mid-Holocene, and again in the early decades of European settlement. Aeolian reactivation, likely driven by European pastoral activities, increases in the most recent 150?years.

Fletcher:2007pedder,"Aim To use surface pollen and vegetation relationships to aid the interpretation of a Holocene pollen record. Location South-west Tasmania, Australia. Methods A survey was undertaken of surface-pollen samples from the major regional vegetation types: alpine, rain forest and moorland. Relationships between vegetation type and surface-pollen representation were analysed using twinspan classification and ordination. A core was retrieved from moorland vegetation, and interpretation of the fossil pollen sequence was aided using relationships detected in our surface-pollen analysis. Results Regional vegetation types are reflected in the pollen rain of south-west Tasmania, despite the over-representation of important rain forest tree species in samples from non-forest sites. twinspan classification of the surface-pollen samples identified the following indicator pollen taxa for each vegetation type: Astelia alpina (alpine); Lagarostrobos franklinii (rain forest); Leptospermum and Melaleuca (moorland). Detrended correspondence analysis of the surface-pollen samples clearly separates samples from each vegetation type. Correlation of the ordination axes with environmental data identified a dominant temperature/altitudinal gradient in the surface-pollen data (R 1/4 0.852/0.844). Application of the results of the surface-pollen analysis to the fossil sequence revealed that firepromoted moorland has dominated the local environment around the core site for the entire Holocene. Changes in fossil pollen composition also suggest that temperatures increased through the Late Glacial to peak in the mid-Holocene and declined thereafter, a trend consistent with other sites in the region. Main conclusions Pollen spectra can successfully be used to predict local vegetation in south-west Tasmania. At least this part of inland south-west Tasmania has remained forest-free throughout the Holocene, conflicting with the dominant palaeoecological paradigm of a mid-Holocene dominated by rain forest. A comparison with pollen records from moorland vegetation across the region suggests that fire-promoted moorland has dominated the landscape since the Late Glacial. We suggest that burning by people through the Late Glacial (if not earlier) facilitated the spread of moorland throughout the region, greatly restricting the expansion of rain forest. The continued influence of fire throughout the Holocene in this perennially wet landscape argues for a revision of the dominant human-occupation model that depicts an abandonment of the interior of south-west Tasmania in the Late Glacial in response to the expansion of rain forest.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Fletcher:2014tasmanian,"Aim: To assess the long-term impacts of landscape fire on a mosaic of pyrophobic and pyrogenic woody montane vegetation. Location: South-west Tasmania, Australia. Methods: We undertook a high-resolution multiproxy palaeoecological analysis of sediments deposited in Lake Osborne (Hartz Mountains National Park, southern Tasmania), employing analyses of pollen, macroscopic and microscopic charcoal, organic and inorganic geochemistry and magnetic susceptibility. Results: Sequential fires within the study catchment over the past 6500 years have resulted in the reduction of pyrophobic rain forest taxa and the establishment of pyrogenic Eucalyptus-dominated vegetation. The vegetation change was accompanied by soil erosion and nutrient losses. The rate of post-fire recovery of widespread rain forest taxa (Nothofagus cunninghamii and Eucryphia spp.) conforms to ecological models, as does the local extinction of fire-sensitive rain forest taxa (Nothofagus gunnii and Cupressaceae) following successive fires. Main conclusions: The sedimentary analyses indicate that recurrent fires over several centuries caused a catchment-wide transition from pyrophobic rain forest to pyrophytic eucalypt-dominated vegetation. The fires within the lake catchment during the 6500-year long record appear to coincide with high frequency El Nino events in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, signalling a potential threat to these highly endemic rain forests if El Ni~no intensity amplifies as predicted under future climate scenarios.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Inter-annual climate anomalies in the study area are driven by changes in both ENSO and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM - an index that describes seasonal to decadal shifts in the SWW), making it an ideal location to test assumptions about the varying influence of the SWW and ENSO, two important components of the global climate system, through time. We find multi-millennial scale trends in fire activity that are remarkably consistent with trends in hydroclimate reconstructed at the same latitude in southern South America, providing empirical support for the notion of zonally symmetric changes in the SWW governing the climate at this latitude in the Southern Hemisphere between 12 and 5 cal ka BP. A transition from multi-millennial scale to sub-millennial scale trends in fire activity occurs after ca 5 cal ka BP in concert with the onset of high frequency and amplitude ENSO variability in the tropical Pacific Ocean region.

Our data indicates an initial resilience of the rainforest system to fire under a stable cool and humid climate regime between ca. 12--6 ka. In contrast, fires that occurred after 6 ka, under an increasingly variable climate regime wrought by the onset of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), resulted in a series of changes within the local rainforest vegetation that culminated in the replacement of rainforest by fire-promoted Eucalypt forest.

Conclusions We conclude that the emergence of an alternative stable pyrogenic state in these relic rainforest systems depends on the extent of pyrophytic species within the system. These findings are critical for understanding resilience in forest ecosystems under future climate and land management changes and are relevant to fire-adapted cool-temperate ecosystems globally.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Fletcher:2021constructed,"Indigenous people play an integral role in shaping natural environments, and the disruption to Indigenous land management practices has profound effects on the biosphere. Here, we use pollen, charcoal and dendrochronological analyses to demonstrate that the Australian landscape at the time of British invasion in the 18th century was a heavily constructed one--the product of millennia of active maintenance by Aboriginal Australians. Focusing on the Surrey Hills, Tasmania, our results reveal how the removal of Indigenous burning regimes following British invasion instigated a process of ecological succession and the encroachment of cool temperate rainforest (i.e. later-stage vegetation communities) into grasslands of conservation significance. This research provides empirical evidence to challenge the long-standing portrayal of Indigenous Australians as low-impact 'hunter-gatherers' and highlights the relevance and critical value of Indigenous fire management in this era of heightened bushfire risk and biodiversity loss.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Fletcher:2021influence,"We aim to understand how did cool temperate rainforest respond to changes in climate and fire activity over the past 18 kcal yrs, interrogating the role that flammable plant species (such as Eucalyptus) have in the long-term dynamics of rainforest vegetation. We used high-resolution pollen and charcoal analysis, radiometric dating (lead and carbon), modern pollen-vegetation relationships, detrended correspondence analysis, rarefaction (palynological richness), rate of change and granger causality to understand the patterns and drivers of change in cool temperate rainforest from the sediments of Lake Vera, southwest Tasmania through time. We record clear changes in key rainforest taxa in response to climatic change throughout the record. The spread of rainforest through the lake catchment in the early and mid-Holocene effectively negated disturbance from fire despite a region-wide peak in fire activity. An anomalously dry period in the late-Holocene resulted in a local fire that facilitated the establishment of Eucalyptus within the local catchment. Granger causality tests reveal a significant lead of Eucalyptus over fire activity in the Holocene, indicating that fires were enhanced by this pyrogenic taxon following establishment.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Florek:1993thesis,"This study examines the variability of the stone assemblages at the mound springs campsites in South Australia. The research area is part of the tribal territories of Arabana and Diyari people. It comprises a network of mound springs stretching for about 200 km along the south and southwest shores of Lake Eyre. These mound springs were vital for permanent occupation of this arid region in late prehistory and in the post contact period. Large campsites located near the major springs attest to the prehistoric occupation of the area. Historical accounts reveal that this occupation was abruptly terminated in early 1 8 6 0‘s. Although environment and chronology are uniform for all the mound spring sites the assemblages are distinctly different. They vary in the proportions of lithic materials, tool types, and artefact size. Inter-site variability is prominent while intrasite variation is minimal. The research is focused on this fact as it provides an important clue to the nature of springs occupation. It is demonstrated that the variability of the mound spring campsites reflects different tactics of use and economy of lithic materials at each site. These tactics were influenced by: a) availability of different lithic materials and b) different demands for processing organic materials. It is argued that assemblage patterning is sensitive to local circumstances, and affected by quantity and quality of resources at each site. Consequently the variability between assemblages reflects the overall organisation and strategy of land use. This study attempts not merely to reconstruct human behaviour at each site but rather to understand how this behaviour was organised on the strategic level. This level of organisation is best represented by the differential use of sites within a common settlement system. Organisation such as this suggests consistent links between groups of people in the mound springs area throughout the last thousand years.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Forbes:2004preliminary,"Radiocarbon age determinations and stratigraphy suggest that the deposits in Black Creek Swamp on Kangaroo Island record 3 phases of deposition and associated soil development which spanned at least the last 20,000 yr. Four new 14C age determinations on bulk soil organic matter and their stratigraphic context are presented in this paper. Three of these age determinations (FP6: 15,687 ± 110 BP [WK11487]; FP7: 16,326 ± 385 BP [WK11488]; and FP8: 17,618 ± 447 BP [WK11489]), are from the organic-rich fossil layer located 45-75 cm below the current floodplain surface. The fourth, a much younger date, FP5: 5589 ± 259 BP (WK11486), was obtained from the base of the overlying modern soil. The dates for the fossil layer increase systematically with depth and correlate well with 5 previous 14C dates (Hope et al., unpublished), ranging between 15,040 ± 120 BP and 19,000 ± 310 BP. This suggests that the data set represents a possible minimum age of the bulk organic matter, and considering the high organic matter contents of approximately 8%, has implications for the age of the megafauna buried in this layer. The overlying modern soil, with its much younger date, contains lower levels of organic matter (3-7%) and gastropods not seen in the fossil layer. This suggests a substantial change in environmental conditions probably due to an alteration in the floodplain drainage conditions. This chronological and sedimentalogical discontinuity indicates that 2 distinct depositional regimes existed and were separated by up to 10,000 14C yr. A calcareous, sandy silt deposit underlying the fossil layer is a calcarenite deposit with low total organic content and is considered the base of the section; it suggests a third separate depositional episode. As such, the Black Creek Swamp in the southwest corner of Kangaroo Island formed intermittently over at least the last 20,000 yr during 3 distinct depositional phases, one of which was the formation of the fossil-laden, organic-rich floodplain surface, which has a possible minimum age of approximately 15,000 to 19,000 BP.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Forbes:2007naracoorte,"The origin of the sediments located in the Naracoorte Caves (South Australia) was investigated via the analysis of strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr), elemental geochemistry, and mineralogy. Sedimentary deposits located in Robertson, Wet, Blanche and several other chambers in Victoria Cave are all variable mixes of fine sand and coarse silts, which display similar and consistent strontium isotope ratios (0.717-0.725). This suggests that over the 400~ka time frame that these deposits span there has been minimal variation in the source of the clastic sediments. Increased strontium concentrations for these cave sediments correspond with increasing silt content, yet there is no correlation between 87Sr/86Sr ratios and silt content. This implies that the silt-sized component of the sediments is the main contributor of strontium to the cave sediments. Comparisons of 87Sr/86Sr with regional surficial deposits show a significant correlation between the cave sediments (avg: 0.7228; n=27), the fine silt lunettes of the Bool Lagoon area (avg: 0.7224; n=4), the sandy A horizons of the Coonawarra Red Brown Earths (RBEs; avg: 0.726; n=5), and Holocene age podsolic sand deposits (0.723). These data suggest that there has been substantial flux from this group of deposits to the caves, as would be expected considering prevailing winds. This relationship is further supported by a strong correlation between many trace elements, including Ti, Zr, Ce, and Y; however, variations in clay mineralogy suggest that the fine silt-dominated lunettes and Padthaway RBEs were not significant contributors to the cave deposits. Hence, the detritus entering the caves was more than likely from areas proximal to the cave entrance and was dominated by medium grain-sized materials. Major regional deposits, including the coarser-grained, calcite-rich Bridgewater Formation sands, basalts from the lower SE, Padthaway Horst granites, Gambier limestone, and metamorphics from the Adelaide geosyncline show minimal correlation in 87Sr/86Sr ratios, elemental geochemistry, and mineralogy with the cave sediments, and are discounted as significant sources. In comparison, 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the Coorong silty sands (0.717-0.724), Lower Murray sands (0.727-0.730), and the medium size silt component of the Murray-Darling River system (0.71-0.72), compare favourably with the cave sediments. This relationship is further supported by similarities in elemental chemistry and mineralogy. Thus, much of the strontium-rich silt that is now located in the Naracoorte Cave sediments likely originated from the Murray-Darling basin. Over time, this material has been transported to the SE of South Australia, where it mixed with the medium sand component of the regressive dune ridge sequence, locally derived organic matter, limestone fragments, and fossil material to produce the unique deposits that we see evident in many of the chambers of the Naracoorte Cave system today.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Forbes:2021interglacials,"The widespread formation of organic rich sediments in south-east Australia during the Holocene (Marine Isotope Stage [MIS] 1) reflects the return of wetter and warmer climates following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Yet, little is known about whether a similar event occurred in the region during the previous interglacial (MIS 5e). A 6.8 m sediment core (#LC2) from the now ephemeral Lake Couridjah, Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, Australia, provides insight into this question. Organic rich sediments associated with both MIS 1 and 5e are identified using 14C and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating techniques. Also apparent are less organic sedimentary units representing MIS 6, 5d and 2 and a large depositional hiatus. Sediment d13C values (34 to 26‰) suggests that C3 vegetation dominates the organic matter source through the entire sequence. The pollen record highlights the prevalence of sclerophyll trees and shrubs, with local hydrological changes driving variations in the abundance of aquatic and lake-margin species. The upper Holocene sediment (0e1.7 m) is rich in organic matter, including high concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC; 20e40 percent), fine charcoal and macrophyte remains. These sediments are also characterised by a large proportion of epiphytic diatoms and a substantial biogenic component (chironomids and midges). These attributes, combined with low d13C and d15N values, and C:N ratios of approximately 20, indicate a stable peat system in a swamp like setting, under the modern/Holocene climate. In comparison, the lower organic rich unit (MIS 5e-d) has less TOC (5e10 percent), is relatively higher in d13C and d15N, and is devoid of macrophyte remains and biogenic material. Characterisation of the organic matter pool using 13C-NMR spectroscopy identified a strong decomposition signal in the MIS 5e organic sediments relative to MIS 1. Thus the observed shifts in d13C, d15N and C:N data between the two periods reflects changes in the organic matter pool, driven by decompositional processes, rather than environmental conditions. Despite this, high proportions of aquatic pollen taxa and planktonic diatoms in the MIS 5eed deposits, and their absence in the Holocene indicates that last interglacial Lake Couridjah was deeper and, or, had more permanent water, than the current one.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Forestier:2018lithic,"Motupore is the name of an island and the archaeological village site located upon it in the Central Province of Papua New Guinea. The occupants of this site have been described as specialist manufacturers of earthenware clay pots. During the late 1800s and early 1900s ethnographers recorded 15 different pot types, two of which were dominant in the assemblage. The pots were transported by voyaging canoes to the Gulf of Papua and primarily exchanged for sago. This exchange network, known as the hiri, began when the site was first occupied about 800 years ago. A recent excavation on Motupore Island in 2016, led by M. Leavesley and T. Beni, found a series of 80 lithic pieces with relatively standardized dimensions. These pieces were collectively categorized as ‘drill points‘ based on their relative homogeneity, but this categorization can be misleading. The first aim of the study was to analyze lithic tools from a techno-morphotypological perspective to better characterize the drill points on Motupore Island. Specifically, our objective was to determine whether a standard production process was followed to manufacture homogeneous points or conversely did production processes vary to manufacture heterogeneous drill points with a few dominant types. Based on quantitative and qualitative characteristics, five morphotypes were identified: truncation, shouldered piece, triangle, bore and point. The second aim of the study was to propose functional uses of these ‘drill points‘ based on macroscopic observations of retouch on the surface of pieces, and to test hypotheses proposed by ethno-historical sources.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This study, of a sand beach ridge plain in northeast Queensland, Australia, using sedimentary analysis and luminescence chronology, suggests there has been considerable variation in both the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones here since the mid-Holocene. Most of the previous beach ridge studies have been of relatively uniform elevation coral shingle, shell and sand beach ridges within the plain. Here, at Rockingham Bay the sediments are composed of coarse-grained sand and there is considerable variation in ridge height and the number of ridges emplaced over different time intervals. It may be that pure sand ridges provide a more sensitive record of variations in long-term tropical cyclone climatology which in turn may contribute to a considerably improved understanding of the behaviour of this natural hazard.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

A switch from coarse to fine-grained sand supply along one part of the beach has caused the development of prograding foredunes in the northeastern sector of the sequence over the past 700 years. Contemporaneously, coarser textured beach ridges have continued to form behind the remainder of the beach. The result is a 'complex barrier' where a single ridge plain contains both foredunes developed through high frequency, low intensity events and beach ridges developed through high intensity, low frequency events associated with intense tropical cyclones.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Forte:2022caucasus,"Hypothesized feedbacks between climate and tectonics are mediated by the relationship between topography and long-term erosion rates. While many studies show monotonic relationships between channel steepness and erosion rates, the degree of nonlinearity in this relationship varies by landscape. Mechanistically explaining controls on this relationship in natural settings is critical because highly nonlinear relationships imply low sensitivity between climate and tectonics. To this end, we present a coordinated analysis of cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in river sands paired with topographic, hydroclimatic, and tectonic data for the Greater Caucasus Mountains where topography is invariant along-strike despite large gradients in modern precipitation and convergence rates. We show that spatial patterns in erosion rates largely reflect regional tectonics with little sensitivity to mean precipitation or runoff. The nonlinearity in the erosion rate – steepness relationship may arise from very low runoff variability, which we attribute to the large contribution from snowmelt. Transitioning from rainfall- to snowmelt-driven runoff as mean elevation increases is common to many mid-latitude mountain ranges. The associated decrease in runoff variability may represent important, unrecognized dynamics inhibiting the sensitivity of tectonics to climate more broadly.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Foster:2016storm,"10Be concentrations in stream sediments are commonly employed to calculate basin-averaged denudation rates. Such calculations assume that denudation is steady in time and that quartz is uniformly distributed in the watershed. The 10Be concentrations in stream sediments are assumed to represent a spatially and temporally averaged concentration, and therefore should not be affected by a discrete erosion event. The effect of such events on 10Be concentrations has been modeled, but has not been previously field-tested following a large precipitation event. In this study, we resampled stream sediments that had been previously analyzed to deduce basin averaged erosion rates in small, tributary basins in the Colorado Front Range following an extreme precipitation event in 2013. Most of our sample sites show no significant change between pre- and post-flood concentrations, and hence no change in the denudation rates inferred from them. The sample locations include a partially burned site, a debris flow site, and sites with very small drainage areas. A notable exception exists at lower Gordon Gulch, within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory; here, local 10Be data indicate that a large portion of flood-deposited sediment is likely derived from deep soils in fans, terraces, and fills, that are predominantly located on the north-facing toe slope. Overall, the reproducibility of denudation rates deduced from pre- and post-storm samples indicates that the uncertainty associated with 10Be-derived denudation rates is likely less than 15\% in this setting.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Evidence of fish remains in this site dating back to 3000 b.p. has led to a revision of a model posited by Walters (1987, 1989) which advocated the establishment of a fishery in the Moreton Region after 2000 b.p. The active procurement of fish by at least 3000 b.p. in southeast Queensland suggests that perhaps people have been maritime hunter-gathers for much longer than was previously though. Although the use of certain coastal sites may have been influenced by environmental dynamics such as sea level fluctuation, it is likely that these sites.were utilised by a people who were preadapted to coastal living.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Fraser:2006naracoorte,"Grant Hall chamber in Victoria Fossil Cave, Naracoorte, South Australia, contains a late Pleistocene faunal assemblage, dated at between 206 and 76 Ka. Taphonomic and faunal analyses indicate that the predominant mode of accumulation was via a surface exposed pitfall trap. An avian predator, such as Tyto alba, may have been responsible for the accumulation of small mammal remains. The faunal assemblage is taxonomically diverse containing at least 47 taxa. It includes many browsing species such as Wallabia bicolour and the extinct Sthenurine kangaroos and Zygomaturus trilobus, as well as small mammals that require trees and a thick understorey. The Grant Hall fauna thus indicates the presence of densely vegetated woodland, interspersed with small patches of open and thickly grassed areas in the proximal vicinity of the old cave entrance. The relative abundances and species composition of the Macropodidae fauna in Grant Hall are significantly different from other faunal assemblages found at Naracoorte.

Fredericksen:1994thesis,"This thesis considers the association between western Melanesian ethnographic economic specialisation and prehistoric systems of production and distribution. Contrasting theories for the development of historical specialisation are reviewed and the criticism made that these are chronologically limited to the late Holocene. The statement is made that to fully appreciate temporal change we must expand our view to encompass the preceramic period. Obsidian is one of the few archaeologically visible materials which was distributed in both preceramic and ceramic times. This material is chosen as a “measuring device” to map variation in production and distribution patterns in the Admiralty Islands, Papua New Guinea. A review of ethnographic and anthropological literature revealed that the Admiralty Islands were characterised by a high level of village or lineagebased economic specialisation. Obsidian was one of the materials produced and distributed within this system. A study was carried out on obsidian use at Pamwak Rocksheiter on Manus Island, and at a number of mid to late Holocene localities on Manus and Mouk. Characterisation analysis revealed that offshore obsidian, probably from the Pam Islands, began to be utilised in the terminal Pleistocene. Trends of increasing accessibility through time and a move to incorporate increasing quantities of Lou obsidian were revealed.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Fu:2017extending,"We show with multiple luminescence dating techniques that the sedimentary record for Lake Eyre, Australia's largest lake, extends beyond 200 thousand years (ka) to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7. Transgressive clayey sand and finely laminated clays overlying the Miocene Etadunna Formation in Lake Eyre North document the deep-lake phases of central South Australia in the past. Until now, unresolved chronology has hampered our ability to interpret these sedimentary records, which are important for understanding the timing of the wettest phase of central Australia's late Quaternary climate. In this study, we apply quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, thermally-transferred OSL (TT-OSL) dating and K-feldspar post infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) dating to lake-floor sediments near Williams Point in Madigan Gulf to provide new age constraint for the lacustrine sediments of Lake Eyre. Methodological studies on quartz and K-feldspar demonstrate that these luminescence dating procedures are suitable for the Lake Eyre lacustrine samples and produce consistent replicate ages. A Bayesian model applied to the new dating results provides a chronological model of lacustrine deposition and shows that the transgressive clayey sand were deposited 221~±~19 ka to 201~±~10 ka and that the deep-water sediments were laid down in early MIS 6 (191~±~9 ka to 181~±~9 ka). We also find evidence for a potential depositional hiatus in mid MIS 6 and the likely formation of a palaeo-playa later in MIS 6 from 158~±~11 ka to 143~±~15 ka. In contrast, the MIS 5 sediments are characterised by oscillating deep- and shallow-water lacustrine units deposited 130~±~16 ka to 113~±~20 ka. This study is the first of its kind to provide evidence for a wet desert interior in Australia beyond the last glacial cycle using comprehensive numerical dating. Our results show that past deep-lake episodes of central South Australia, which were previously thought to represent peak interglacial conditions, are actually associated with both warm interglacial and cold glacial periods, with all the wettest episodes generally coinciding with the intervening periods between the glacial and interglacial maximums. We assume from these results that orbital forcing is not a first order control for the long-term dynamics of the Lake Eyre basin and the Indo-Australian monsoon. The high lake-level events of Lake Eyre are well correlated with millennial-scale cooling events and stadials of the North Atlantic, and coincide with weakened episodes/events for the East Asia summer monsoon. This may imply an important role for the northern high latitudes in influencing the Indo-Australian monsoon, which may be associated with a southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during cooling periods in the North Atlantic.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Based on paleopedological and sedimentological parameters, three former land surfaces were identified and associated with different assemblages. A chronostratigraphy of the various land surfaces was established by applying optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The youngest former land surface is represented by a dune generation (AD2) which stabilized at a maximum of 5 ka. An older dune generation (AD1) shows a more heterogeneous age pattern where deposition started at ca. 27 ka with a maximum estimated age of stabilization at ca. 10 ka. Both of these dune generations overlie a weathered calcrete complex of Middle to Late Pleistocene age.

Fuchs:2015pamir,"A clear understanding of erosion processes is fundamental in order to comprehend the evolution of actively deforming mountain ranges. However, the relative contributions of tectonic and climatic factors and their feedbacks remain highly debated. In order to contribute to the debate, we quantify basin-wide denudation rates from cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in modern river sediments in the Pamir. This mountain range is a unique natural laboratory because the ongoing India–Eurasia collision sustains high deformation rates and, on account of its position at the transition between Westerlies and monsoon, a strong regional climatic variability arises. Sample acquisition and preparation for accelerator mass spectrometry measurements were challenging due to difficult field accessibility, low quartz and high feldspar concentrations and crystal coating. Six samples along the main draining river, the Panj, and five samples within the major, east–west elongated tributary basins allow us to quantify basin-wide denudation rates for the first time in this orogen. An average denudation rate of ~ 0.64 mm yr−1 reveals a rapid evolution of the entire Pamir. Denudation rates of tributary sub-basins highlight the strong contrast between the Pamir Plateau (0.05 to 0.16 mm yr−1) and its margins (0.54 to 1.45 mm yr−1).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Gaffney:2015crossing,"This paper emphasises sub-regional variation in the timing and nature of subsistence changes in the New Guinea Highlands at the Pleistocene–Holocene transition. An analysis of the Kiowa lithic assemblage was used to examine the interplay between tool technology, mobility levels, and subsistence strategies by investigating changes in the procurement, manufacture, and use of different raw stone materials in an overall lithic technology. Throughout Kiowa’s occupation local stone was used extensively, and over time people increased their knowledge of the local lithic landscape, using more diverse local raw materials. Since the terminal Pleistocene, people carried reliable polished axes for a variety of activities and made expedient use of locally abundant river pebbles, while smaller nodules were located and carried as mobile toolkits to facilitate longer distance hunting and collecting excursions. In the mid Holocene exotic raw materials were also traded from more distant zones. The abandonment of Kiowa in the late Holocene shows that hunting became less economically important as cultivation developed in the area. Technological changes, in combination with changes in faunal remains are suggestive of increasing activity at Kiowa through the Holocene as the site became specialised for bat hunting, perhaps driven by restricted land use and reduced mobility, reciprocally affected by increasing populations and the intensification of plant food production in the Highlands generally. Despite this, evidence for changes to horticulture around Kiowa itself, in the Chimbu area, is limited to the mid-late Holocene, indicating that the early development of agriculture in the Wahgi may have been relatively localised, and did not necessarily displace existing subsistence strategies elsewhere in the Highlands.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

However, faunal sequences from these environments that shed light on past hunting practices are rare. In this paper we assess zooarchaeological evidence from Yuku and Kiowa, two sites that span that Pleistocene to Holocene boundary in the New Guinea Highlands. We present new AMS radiocarbon dates and a revision of the stratigraphic sequences for these sites, and examine millennial-scale changes to vertebrate faunal composition based on NISP, MNI, and linear morphometric data to shed light on variability in hunting practices, processes of natural cave deposition, and the local palaeoenvironment at the end of the LGM through to the Late Holocene. We show that Yuku was first occupied at least c. 17,500 years ago and that Late Pleistocene–Early Holocene hunters targeted a wide range of small-bodied and agile species from the mid-montane forest, with a particular focus on cuscus (Phalanger spp.). At Kiowa, occupied from around 12,000 years ago, a similar range of species were targeted, but with an added emphasis on specialised Dobsonia magna fruit bat hunting. We then integrate other zooarchaeological data from the wider Highlands zone to build a model of generalist-specialist hunting dynamics and examine how this more broadly contributes to our understanding of tropical foraging during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Gale:2009chronostratigraphy,"The most recent part of the geological timescale presents us with some of the greatest challenges for dating. With the exception of 230Th/234U methods, whose use is restricted to rather specific depositional environments, there is no established geochronometric tool capable of dating more than a fraction of the recent past at a resolution adequate to tackle the environmental issues of this period. Event stratigraphy, the investigation of comparatively rare and abrupt occurrences that leave some trace in the stratigraphic record, has been widely employed as a means of correlation and dating of older geological strata. Yet this approach has frequently been overlooked in efforts to establish chronologies of the recent past. It is ironic, therefore, that because of the acceleration of human activity, stratigraphic events have almost certainly occurred with greater frequency over the last few centuries than at any preceding time in Earth history. Because the history of human-induced events is usually well-established, the markers of such events have immense chronostratigraphic value. They may be employed in circumstances in which radiometric techniques may not be suitable, and may offer higher-resolution dates than those associated with conventional dating methods. Dated event horizons may also provide the essential means by which to validate geochronometric analyses of the recent past. Event markers may be divided into those that produce discontinuities in the rock record and those (of much greater value in the terrestrial deposits that are the focus of most investigations of the recent past) that leave some tangible signal in the rocks. These signals may be the result of either natural factors or human-induced processes, and may occur in a range of temporal contexts. They may mark the instant of occurrence of a short-lived phenomenon, or they may represent the abrupt disappearance or sudden appearance of some feature. This paper reviews each of these markers, focussing specifically on their application to the chronology of the recent past and the global environmental transformation that has taken place during this time.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Garamszegi:2014inland,"In this thesis I explore the applicability of the ethnographic settlement-subsistence model of ‘inland‘ versus ‘coastal‘ cultural groups to archaeological site Edubu 2. Edubu 2 is located 1.17 km inland in the Caution Bay foothills, Papua New Guinea. Human occupation at the site dates from c. 2950 to c. 1360 cal BP. Ethnographers and colonial observers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and some archaeologists of the late twentieth century, have developed a dichotomous settlement-subsistence model regarding two Caution Bay language and cultural groups. The Koita were described as an ‘inland‘-focussed people based on their settlement and subsistence patterns. The Motu, on the other hand, were described as ‘coastal‘-focussed people. To test this dual model, shell remains from Edubu 2 are identified, quantified and categorised into their originating habitats, in order to establish which resource zones were being accessed by the past inhabitants of the site. My analysis and subsequent interpretations suggest entirely coastal- focussed subsistence resourcing, and a shunning of freshwater environments by the past inhabitants of inland site Edubu 2. Thus, the model of ‘inland‘ versus ‘coastal‘ peoples cannot be applied to Edubu 2. In effect, this study questions the veracity of the original ethnographic model, as well as the total omission of shellfishing from colonial observations in the broader Port Moresby region.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Garcin:2017kenya,"The African Humid Period (AHP) between ∼15 and 5.5 cal. kyr BP caused major environmental change in East Africa, including filling of the Suguta Valley in the northern Kenya Rift with an extensive (∼2150 km2), deep (∼300 m) lake. Interfingering fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Baragoi paleo-delta provide insights into the lake-level history and how erosion rates changed during this time, as revealed by delta-volume estimates and the concentration of cosmogenic 10Be in fluvial sand. Erosion rates derived from delta-volume estimates range from 0.019 to 0.03 mm yr−1. 10Be-derived paleo-erosion rates at ∼11.8 cal. kyr BP ranged from 0.035 to 0.086 mm yr−1, and were 2.7 to 6.6 times faster than at present. In contrast, at ∼8.7 cal. kyr BP, erosion rates were only 1.8 times faster than at present. Because 10Be-derived erosion rates integrate over several millennia, we modeled the erosion-rate history that best explains the 10Be data using established non-linear equations that describe in situ cosmogenic isotope production and decay. ...

It was not possible to date in situ organic carbon and adjacent aeolian quartz particles, so the comparison of dates is for lithostratigraphic units. The TL dates were calculated using two methods of estimating dose rates, and no significant differences were found between the results. The TL dates at all sites agree with and extend the range of ages given by radiocarbon for the lithostratigraphic units. None of the TL dates contradicts the ages given by radiocarbon. The agreement between the results of the two dating methods gives confidence in TL dates which are well beyond the range of the conventional radiocarbon method, examples of which are given in this paper.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Gardner:2006liptrap,"Sea cliffs along the western coast of Cape Liptrap at Arch Rock provide nearly continuous exposure of calcareous eolianites dated at 68–112ka (five optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages). Calcareous eolian deposition began immediately after the last interglacial marine highstand (Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 5e) and continued during sea level fall until the beginning of OIS 4. West-southwesterly winds transported calcareous sand across ∼12km of exposed continental shelf by the beginning of OIS 4. A brief period of cold, arid, windy continental climate with ephemeral, but intense, surface runoff immediately preceded the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This resulted in fluvial reworking of the calcarenites into an alluvial fan dated at 23–25ka (four OSL ages). The fan overlies peat dated at 25,279yr cal BP and is capped by a paleosol dated at 6010yr cal BP. Concurrent eolian reworking by northwesterly winds of siliceous sediments on marine terraces along the eastern and central portion of Cape Liptrap formed siliceous longitudinal dunes with ages ranging from 19 to 24ka (five OSL ages).

Radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) dating of marine terraces on Cape Liptrap are used to constrain rates of displacement across the reactivated Waratah Fault. Six marine terraces, numbered Qt6-Tt1 (youngest to oldest), are well developed at Cape Liptrap with altitudes ranging from ~1.5 m to ~170 m amsl, respectively. On the lowest terrace, Qt6, barnacles in wave-cut notches ~1.5 m amsl, yielded a radiocarbon age of 6090-5880 Cal BP, and reflect the local mid-Holocene sea level highstand. Qt5 yielded four OSL ages from scattered locations around the cape ranging from ~80 ka to ~130 ka. It formed during the Last Interglacial sea level highstand (MIS 5e) at ~125 ka. Inner edge elevations (approximate paleo high tide line) for Qt5 occur at distinctly different elevations on opposite sides of the Waratah Fault. ... [_truncated_]",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

The genus Platygonus (middle Pliocene to early Pleistocene) is registered in Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, and Bolivia; Catagonus (late Pliocene? to Recent) in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Bolivia; and Tayassu (middle Pleistocene to Recent) in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Platygonus and Catagonus have adaptations to dry and relatively open environments; in contrast, Tayassu is adapted mainly to humid climates and woodland and forest environments. The faunal changes that took place since the middle-late Pliocene could have been strongly influenced by climate. Open and arid environments developed during the glacial cycles, allowing the latitudinal expansion of Platygonus and Catagonus. ... [_truncated_]",2023-01-20 10:09:29.977 +0100,

Gell:1993gippsland,"Three fine-resolution pollen, charcoal and statigraphic records are presented from Tea Tree Swamp, East Gippsland, Victoria. There is evidence for low levels of burning before European contact in Eucalyptus forest with an understorey dominated by shrubs and grasses. The burning activities of leasehold settlers, as well as burning and clearing by miners and timber cutters significantly increased the incidence of fire, reducing the cover of shrubs and permitting grasses to dominate the understorey. This is associated with a minor hydrological change indicated by increased representation of Myriophyllum, as well as an increase in the rate of sediment accumulation. Evidence is presented for the recovery of the shrub vegetation and a decline in the dominance of grasses after the inception of fire suppression measures invoked in response to severe fires in Victoria in AD 1939. All three cores show a substantial increase in the abundance of either Sphagnum or Myriophyllum pollen in recent times.

Gell:2007wetlands,"The condition of floodplain wetlands is a function of internal and external forces and functions. Wetlands vary longitudinally down a floodplain following principals enshrined in the River Continuum Concept whereby the nature and concentration of solutes and sediments change with distance from source. This observation pertains directly to the main river channels but influences the wetland mostly in times of flood as, during low flow, connection between the river and the wetland may be severed. This exchange between river and wetland (described in Hillman, 1986) varies transversely across the floodplain with wetlands proximal to the main channel having longer and more frequent connection than wetlands at the floodplain margin. In the Murray Darling Basin the condition of the main channel has been impacted by human settlement and development that has increased the flux of nutrients, sediment and salts and regulated flow and extracted water. As a result the water of the main lowland rivers of the Murray Darling Basin is more saline, nutrient rich and turbid. The flows of the rivers have become lower, less variable and of lower amplitude with natural winter/spring peak flows skewed towards spring/summer to accommodate the irrigation industry (Jones et al., 2002; Norris et al., 2002). As a result of these changes the quality of the water entering floodplain wetlands has declined. In response to this degradation of wetland condition there has been deliberate action to rehabilitate and restore wetlands across Australia.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,
Genever:2003whitehaven,"Palynological study of Whitehaven Swamp, Whitsunday Island, provides the first Holocene palaeoenvironmental record for the Whitsunday region on the central Queensland coast. Sediment stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating indicate continuous freshwater swamp conditions since around 7000 radiocarbon years Before Present (BP). Pollen and charcoal analyses provide local and regional vegetation and fire histories for the site and surrounding area. Varying representation of swamp elements, particularly Leptocarpus and Cyperaceae, provides evidence for phases of permanent and ephemeral swamp conditions. The regional vegetation record is dominated by rainforest, sclerophyll and beach strand elements. Strongest rainforest representation occurs around the mid-Holocene, while sclerophyll elements increase from the late Holocene to present. Charcoal analyses indicate that fire has been a constant component of the Whitsunday environment throughout the period represented. Negative correlation between high charcoal and Leptocarpus pollen concentrations suggests a strong local component to the charcoal record and a history of on-site burning during ephemeral swamp phases. The vegetation reconstruction suggests moister than present conditions at Whitehaven between approximately 7000 to 4500 BP. This complies with claims for a mid-Holocene climatic optimum based on pollen records from the Atherton Tableland to the north, but contrasts with suggested mid-Holocene aridity based on a surrogate lake water level record from Fraser Island to the south. Comparisons with the regional archaeological record provide no evidence for direct links between major environmental change and archaeologically identified cultural change. In particular, claims for late Holocene population intensification are not matched by changes in the charcoal record. This may suggest that widespread vegetation burning was not a predominant feature of hunter^gatherer strategies that were focused towards marine resources, and/or that human-induced fire regimes were already well entrenched prior to intensification.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

There are no acceptable results on charcoal from hearth/ovens older than ca. 31 ka bp, and no evidence that these samples are associated with numerous midden shell dates at 34-37 ka bp.

The oldest occupation horizons in four different regions reliably dated by defendable multi-method results are in the range 42-48,000 calendar years ago, overlapping with the age range for similarly well-dated undisturbed sites containing the youngest extinct megafauna.

We argue that the published studies on the Cuddie Springs claypan deposits do not show a stratified and undisturbed Late Pleistocene archaeological site, as proposed by the excavators, instead revealing a palimpsest of Late Holocene and European occupational debris superimposed on a much longer-term record of Quaternary landscape evolution.

Gillespie:2012megafauna,"Recent discussion on the late Pleistocene extinction of the Australian megafauna has revolved around interpretation of several key fossil sites in Tasmania. It has been suggested that humans did not arrive in Tasmania until after the megafauna became extinct, or did not hunt now extinct megafauna, and therefore that humans cannot be implicated in the extinctions. Radiocarbon results from these sites indicate that the youngest extinct megafauna are close to charcoal ages from the oldest archaeological deposits, although difficulties have arisen in establishing chronologies because most relevant sites have ages near the limit for radiocarbon analysis. We report a series of new radiocarbon ages, δ13C, δ15N and C:N ratios on collagen and dentine fractions from skeletal remains in the Mount Cripps karst area and the Mowbray Swamp, both in northwestern Tasmania, and discuss the reliability of ages from these and other sites. We also report the discovery of an articulated Simosthenurus occidentalis skeleton at Mt Cripps, that represents only the second directly-dated extinct megafaunal taxon with a reliable age <50 ka cal BP from Tasmania. Our results suggest that C:N ratios measured on collagen or dentine are not an infallible guide to radiocarbon age reliability. We confirm previous reports of a temporal overlap between the megafaunal and archaeological records in Tasmania, but the presence of archaeological evidence and megafauna with the same age at the same site has not yet been demonstrated. At least two megafaunal taxa—the now-extinct Protemnodon anak and a giant Pleistocene form of the extant Macropus giganteus—were still present in Tasmania after 43 ka, when human crossing of the Bassian landbridge from mainland Australia first became sustainable.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Data on accumulation rates, with sediment chemistry and magnetic properties, suggest that during the late Pleistocene erosion rates were minimal under stable primary forest. Horticultural intensification in the last 6,000 years has resulted in dramatically increased rates of hillslope erosion, especially in the last 300-400 years. The latter change may be associated with the introduction of sweet potato as a staple crop in swidden horticulture. A derived model of limestone soil stability suggests that soil buffering capacity may be critical in resisting irreversible soil degradation and slope stripping. Both long fallow and diversified swidden cropping may reduce the risk of such irreversible erosional hazards.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gillieson:1989environmental,"The Jimi River falls four kilometres down the northern slopes of the Bismarck Range, and has cut a deep valley into the edge of the central mountain chain. Over the few million years of its battle with the Highlands, one episode has temporarily defeated the river. It could not cope with the overwhelming mass of debris avalanching down from the volcanic vents of the Hagen Range. While the southern part of the Lai was filled by ash and mud lahars to form the Wahgi plain, other ashes were swept down the Lai to form immense alluvial fans that blocked the lower Jimi and spread out into tributary valleys. The main volcanic activity ceased about 200,000 years ago; since then erosion has cut steep gorges along the northern end of the Ruti plain. However, that part of the valley called the Ruti Flats is still infilled by hundreds of metres of volcanic debris and presents, like the Wahgi, a gentle hummocky topography that contrasts with the sweep of the ranges above it. In the time since people have settled in this landscape the main process has been steady erosion. Yet, if we want to know what has happened, to forests, climates, soils and the human cultures themselves, we have to find places where landscape has not only been stable, but even built up by sediments formed from hillwash, or materials such as rotting vegetation or even occupational debris. This usually means looking for swamps, lakes or caves, as these places provide a temporary lodgement for sediments that may preserve a few tens of thousands of years of accumulation. Once found, such sediment accumulations provide a story; the type, the timing and rate of accumulation of sediments provides a history of erosion elsewhere or changes in hydrology. Suitable sediments can be dated radiometrically and analysed for a range of attributes, physical, chemical or biological. This data must then be interpreted to provide a history of the site, and from this at least some kind of picture of the landscape around can emerge. The search for places of accumulation took us to rock shelters, river terraces, swampy hollows on the Ruti Flats, and a shallow lake high in the catchment above Ruti (Figure 6.1 ) .",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Glaus:2019landquart,"This paper focuses on the Landquart drainage basin, where we explore geomorphic signals related to the spatial differences in bedrock lithology and differential uplift. We use concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be to quantify the sediment flux patterns in the region. Furthermore we use the chemical composition of the fine fraction (< 63 μm) of the river sediment to determine the provenance of the material, and we quantify the landscape properties through the calculation of normalized steepness values for the tributary basins. The results show that the upstream segment of the Landquart basin is a glacially imprinted landscape and contributes to about 20–50\% of the total modern sediment flux of the Landquart River. Contrariwise, the landscape of the downstream part is dominated by a V-shaped landscape where tributary basins are characterized by a generally high steepness. This downstream area has delivered about 50–80\% of the total eroded material. Because this lowermost part of the Landquart basin is c. 50\% smaller than the upstream region (200 km2 downstream versus 400 km2 upstream), the sediment budget points to very high erosion at work in this lowermost segment. ...

Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence from sediments supplemented by 14C from charcoal and lacustrine shells was obtained to date shoreline deposits (Lake Callabonna) and the adjacent Mt Chambers Creek alluvial fan. Our findings are complemented by a U/Th-based record of speleothem growth in the Mt Chambers Creek catchment, which we interpret to reflect increased precipitation. Together, these archives shed light on the timing of, and possible sources of water for, Holocene pluvial intervals. We identified several phases of elevated lake levels dated at ~5.8-5.2, 4.5, 3.5-2.7 and 1 kyr, most of which correspond to fluvial activity resulting from increased precipitation in the adjacent ranges. The enhanced hydrology during phases of the late Holocene likely increased the reliability of resources for regional human populations during a time of reduced winter rainfall. When considered within the framework of the current understanding of Holocene palaeoclimate in central Australia, our data suggest that the pattern of landscape response was broadly synchronous with larger scale climatic variability and punctuated by pluvial periods greater than today.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gliganic:2016mixing,"Post-depositional mixing processes are extremely common and often obscure a record of deposition in dune and sand sheet deposits. We show that the upper half metre of a dune in southeastern Australia is currently being turned over through bioturbation, but that single-grain OSL dating and contextual knowledge can be used to identify and model these modern mixing processes. In the sandy deposits investigated, mixing processes were observed to be acting to a predicable depth of ∼50–60 cm. This observation was used to develop a conceptual framework that can be applied to buried deposits and used to temporally constrain the evolution of the landform and quantify rates of mixing. When our mixing zone conceptual framework was combined with the MAM we show that phases of significant dune aggradation occurred at ∼29.9, ∼18.3, ∼10.3 ka, and continued through the Holocene. We also present an approach using single-grain OSL data to estimate downward mixing rates, which show a strong depth dependency and are coherent with previously reported mixing rates. Modern downward mixing rates indicate that the upper ∼50 cm (Zone 1) will be completely turned over on millennial time scales. While caution needs to be used when interpreting archaeological and OSL data from bioturbated sandy environments, our results demonstrate that contextual knowledge and single-grain OSL data can resolve mixing processes and contribute to an understanding of landscape evolution.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Glotzbach:2013glacially,"In many regions, tectonic uplift is the main driver of erosion over million‐year (Myr) timescales, but climate changes can markedly affect the link between tectonics and erosion, causing transient variations in erosion rates. Here we study the driving forces of millennial to Myr‐scale erosion rates in the French Western Alps, as estimated from in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be and a newly developed approach integrating detrital and bedrock apatite fission‐track thermochronology. Millennial erosion rates from 10Be analyses vary between ~0.27 and ~1.33 m/kyr, similar to rates measured in adjacent areas of the Alps. Significant positive correlations of millennial erosion rates with geomorphic measures, in particular with the LGM ice thickness, reveal a strong transient morphological and erosional perturbation caused by repeated Quaternary glaciations. The perturbation appears independent of Myr‐scale uplift and erosion gradients, with the effect that millennial erosion rates exceed Myr‐scale erosion rates only in the internal Alps where the latter are low (<0.4 km/Myr). These areas, moreover, exhibit channels that clearly plot above a general linear positive relation between Myr‐scale erosion rates and normalized steepness index. Glacial erosion acts irrespective of rock uplift and thus not only leads to an overall increase in erosion rates but also regulates landscape morphology and erosion rates in regions with considerable spatial gradients in Myr‐scale tectonic uplift. Our study demonstrates that climate change, e.g., through occurrence of major glaciations, can markedly perturb landscape morphology and related millennial erosion rate patterns, even in regions where Myr‐scale erosion rates are dominantly controlled by tectonics.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We provide correction lines for the full parameter space explored (glacial denudation: 0.01–100 m; post‐glacial denudation rate: 1–1000 mm/ka; deglaciation: 1–100 ka before present), to evaluate and, if necessary, correct denudation rates for the impact of glacial denudation.

Gloury:2016congeneric,"Knowledge of species diets is critical to assisting our understanding of their ecology. Using microhistological analysis of faecal samples, we described and compared the diets of sympatrically occurring folivorous congenerics, common and mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula and T. cunninghami, respectively). Throughout the 28-month study period, common brushtails relied heavily on eucalypt foliage, particularly very young leaves, which is consistent with data from captive studies on their dietary physiology. In contrast, eucalypt foliage formed only a small part of the diet of mountain brushtails, which instead relied heavily on silver wattle foliage. The mean number of plant groups per faecal sample was significantly greater for common brushtails than mountain brushtails. No significant differences in diet between male and female mountain brushtails were detected. However, intraspecific differences in diet occurred for common brushtails: the diet of females included significantly less eucalypt foliage and significantly more foliage of the exotic, tree lucerne, than that of males during the Wet Season (April-November), but not during the Dry Season (December-March). Diets varied temporally for both species, with some individuals feeding on seasonally available resources. The diets described for common and mountain brushtails are consistent with those of a dry-adapted and mesic-adapted species, respectively. We discuss how our results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of both study species, and more broadly the family Phalangeridae to which they belong. We also consider the diet of our study species in the context of recent advances in our understanding of interactions between plants that produce secondary metabolites, and mammals specialized to feed on them.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,
GML:2019george,"In 2016 the Parramatta Park George Street Gatehouse was refurbished, and a café fitout undertaken. To operate as a café a service trench connecting to the existing Gatehouse sewer line and grease trap was required. A grease trap arrestor was installed adjacent to the café. Archaeological test excavation in 2015 had identified that the raised flat landform, adjacent to the Gatehouse, comprised the Parramatta sand body. Evidence for Aboriginal use of the landform had also been identified during the 2015 testing, in the form of stone artefacts. The Parramatta sand body is recognised as very significant because it contains time-depth evidence for Aboriginal occupation in Parramatta. This means that the Aboriginal artefacts located at the bottom of the sand sheet are far older than those at the top. Prior to this project, the formation process of the Parramatta sand body was not understood. Opportunities to examine the Parramatta sand body are rare, and very little is known regarding the basic physical characteristics of the sand materials, let alone the correlation with the numerous Aboriginal objects recovered through archaeological salvage excavations. Previous archaeological work (on Aboriginal site RTA-G1) had confirmed that Aboriginal people started living in Parramatta, on the sand body, approximately 30,000 years ago. The most recent excavations in 2016 which are the subject of this report has confirmed these earlier findings but increased the date of occupation to approximately 40,000 years. To manage the impacts of ground disturbance around the café, and recover archaeological and geomorphological information, GML and representatives of the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council hand-excavated the service trench between 29 March and 1 April 2016. We took samples from the Parramatta sand body to test its chemical properties and date the deposit. The excavation resulted in the recovery of a limited amount of highly significant Aboriginal archaeological evidence. A total of 39 items demonstrating Aboriginal use of the area were retrieved from the excavation. Eight stone artefacts were recovered; one item was deep within the archaeological trench. An Aboriginal ochre cooking pit was identified, as well as 30 pieces of ochre—22 red pieces and eight yellow pieces. A single knapped (worked or shaped) ceramic item was identified. The artefacts add to our knowledge of how Aboriginal people used the area and provide evidence for interaction between Aboriginal people and settlers post-1788. The geomorphology results were surprising and present significant new information on how and when the sand sheet formed. We used the optically-stimulated luminescence dating technique, which dates the last time that the quartz in the sands were exposed to light. We understand now that between 56,000 and 40,000 years ago a large flood event brought massive quantities of sandy clay down the Parramatta River valley. Sandy clay was deposited on the northern and southern banks of the river. Our date for this event corresponds with previous investigations, which had indicated the sandy clay was deposited between 58,000 and 50,000 years ago. Our research provides direct evidence that Aboriginal people started living adjacent to the river, on the Parramatta sand body, around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago. When they started to live on the sandy clay, the wind slowly eroded the sand (it became windblown or aeolian sand). The sand was then through time redeposited over the sites and places inhabited by Aboriginal people, gradually burying the material items they had created. The outcome of this process is the buried Aboriginal sites we find across Parramatta on the sand today. This work provides the first evidence for how the Parramatta sand body was formed. It also provides dates for the formation event, and the commencement of Aboriginal occupation on the sand sheet in Parramatta. The date obtained is the oldest date for Aboriginal archaeology in Sydney. The work has demonstrated the importance and significance of the Parramatta sand body to all Australians, but notably the Aboriginal community. In addition, the findings add a new dimension to the heritage significance of Parramatta Park and the hidden archaeological landscape preserved here. The Gardens Precinct holds considerable potential to create and reconnect contemporary Aboriginal people with their Country and ancestors. Investigations into the archaeology, archaeobotany and geomorphology of the area may provide opportunities to further explore ancient Aboriginal social and aesthetic landscapes within Parramatta. The reconstruction and interpretation of these landscapes presents opportunities for public education and long-term conservation, in a part of the city, Parramatta Park, that will not be subject to further development pressures.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,
Godard:2010regressive,"The Longmen Shan range is one of the major topographic and structural features of the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. With an impressive topographic gradient and low convergence rates across the range this region has raised important questions concerning the dynamics of plateau margin settings, such as the long-term mechanisms of topographic evolution. The investigation of the distribution in space and time of denudation can provide critical insight into such dynamics and shed light on still unresolved controversies. For that purpose, we present a new dataset that documents the intensity and distribution of denudation processes across this plateau margin through field survey of fluvial incision markers, quantitative geomorphology and cosmogenic nuclide derived basin-wide erosion rates. Erosion is < 0.5 mm/year in the frontal region of the Longmen Shan and between 0.5 and 1 mm/year further west, with a gradual decrease when reaching the northern headwaters of the Min Jiang watershed, adjacent to the beginning of the Tibetan Plateau. The spatial distribution of denudation inferred from the various methods we use suggests that most of the differential uplift in the Central Longmen Shan is accommodated by the Beichuan Fault and frontal structures located in the foothills. The denudation pattern seems also to reflect the large-scale propagation of erosion from the Sichuan Basin toward the Plateau. This suggests that the Longmen Shan range is submitted to the combined influences of slow thrusting activity on the frontal structures and progressive westward regressive erosion as a probable response to a pulse of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau Eastern margin, that started 10 Ma ago.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

To address this question, denudation rates at centennial to millennial time scales were deduced from 10Be concentrations in detrital sediments derived from 30 small basins (10–600 km2) in an ∼200-km-wide region in central Nepal. Along a northward, strike-perpendicular transect, average denudation rates sharply increase from <0.5 mm/yr in the Lesser Himalayas to ∼1 mm/yr when crossing the Physiographic Transition, and then accelerate to 2–3 mm/yr on the southern flank of the high peaks in the Greater Himalayas.

We use catchment wide denudation rates calculated from cosmogenic nuclides concentrations and high resolution topographic analysis to constrain landscape dynamics across the South Eastern Australian Escarpment. We determined denudation rates of ∼15 mm/ka in the lowlands at the foot of the escarpment and of ∼10 mm/ka in the highlands, while catchment draining the escarpment face display rates in the 20–60 mm/ka range. These denudation rates along a passive margin escarpment are among the highest in the world and show greater sensitivity to topographic gradients when compared to other passive margin settings. We interpret this situation as resulting from the intermediate precipitation regime of our study area, as opposed to drier or wetter settings, where hillslope processes can be inhibited due to water availability or deep weathering profiles and vegetation feedbacks, respectively. Combined with the extraction of topographic metrics across the escarpment, these rates allow us to constrain efficiency coefficients for fluvial incision and hillslope diffusion that are similar to other independent estimates in this region. These coefficients are used to calculate an escarpment retreat rate of 40 to 80 mm/ka over the last 100s of ka. Our analysis of high resolution hillslope morphological properties suggests widespread small-scale disequilibrium across this landscape, illustrating the pervasiveness of transience across all spatial scales in this geomorphological setting",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Godfrey:1989chronology,"Over the years there has been a growing debate about the changes which may have occurred during the Late Holocene in eastern Australia. Some prehistorians have argued that there is evidence for an increase in the Aboriginal population (Beaton 1985; Hughes and Lampert 1982), while others say that the evidence demonstrates that Aboriginal society intensified the relationships between groups, and the way the environment was exploited (Lourandos 1983, Luebbers 1978). While use may be made of ethnohistory, the evidence for climatic changes and archaeology to support these models, there are at least two factors which have been assumed by some. The changes, which may have occurred in either or both the Aboriginal population and its social and subsistence strategies, happened over the whole of eastern mainland Australia, and that the results of shell midden studies support these models (Beaton 1985, Lourandos 1985, Morwood 1987).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Goede:1985electron,"Fourteen bone samples are analysed to test the usefulness of equivalent dose (ED) determinations by electron spin resonance (ESR) as a rapid method of determining relative age and making an estimate of absolute age. ED values are compared with eight aspartic acid dates and two C14 dates. The latter are dates on charcoal found in close association with bone at archaeological sites. For samples less than 25 000 years old an excellent correlation is obtained when ED values are compared with dates obtained by the other two methods. The relationship suggests that ED values can be converted to estimates of bone age by assuming a mean annual dose rate of 0.1 rad/yr. Age determinations provide little evidence to support earlier suggestions that elements of the Late Pleistocene megafauna survived until the end of the Pleistocene. Bone material at some sites in the-Florentine Valley and near Montagu appears to be much older than had previously been believed. Only one site (Main Cave, Montagu) containing megafaunal elements appears to be terminal Pleistocene in age but the possibility of reworking of megafauna material from nearby older sites cannot be excluded. ESR dating has considerable potential as an exploratory dating tool but can only be applied to dense, unaltered bone samples.

Studies of caves commenced with an investigation of bone-rich deposits, many of which contained remains of Pleistocene megafauna. The thesis concentrates on aspects of stratigraphy, dating and interpretation of depositional environments. Discovery of an archaeological site led to the realisation that interior valleys of Tasmania had been colonised by aborigines during the Last Glacial. Later studies concentrated on the use of speleothems as an information source on past climates and environments and used analysis of stable isotope ratios and minor element concentrations to study temporal variations.

Goff:2017aitape,"There is increasing recognition of the long-lasting effects of tsunamis on human populations. This is particularly notable along tectonically active coastlines with repeated inundations occurring over thousands of years. Given the often high death tolls reported from historical events though it is remarkable that so few human skeletal remains have been found in the numerous palaeotsunami deposits studied to date. The 1929 discovery of the Aitape Skull in northern Papua New Guinea and its inferred late Pleistocene age played an important role in discussions about the origins of humans in Australasia for over 25 years until it was more reliably radiocarbon dated to around 6000 years old. However, no similar attention has been given to reassessing the deposit in which it was foundÐa coastal mangrove swamp inundated by water from a shallow sea. With the benefit of knowledge gained from studies of the 1998 tsunami in the same area, we conclude that the skull was laid down in a tsunami deposit and as such may represent the oldest known tsunami victim in the world. These findings raise the question of whether other coastal archaeological sites with human skeletal remains would benefit from a re-assessment of their geological context.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here he saw being uncovered the same sort of evidence for prehistoric drainage and cultivation that colleagues and myself had briefly investigated three years previously at the Manton site on Warrawau Tea Plantation a few kilometres away on the other side of the Wahgi river (Golson et al. 1967; Lampert 1967).

Based on optically stimulated luminescence dating, the records archived within the world's largest sand island span a period that has the potential to exceed 750 ka and contain specific records that are of extremely high resolution over the past 40,000 years. This is due to the geographic position of Fraser Island, which lies in the coastal subtropical region of Queensland Australia. Fraser Island is exposed to the open ocean currents of the Coral Sea on the east coast and the waters of Hervey Bay on its western margin and is positioned to receive moisture from the Indo-Australian monsoon, southeast trade winds and experiences occasional tropical and ex-tropical cyclones. We review literature that presents the current level of understanding of sea level change, ecological variation and environmental change on Fraser Island.

New data from 14 watersheds in the states of Santa Catarina (n = 7) and Rio de Janeiro (n = 7) show that erosion rates vary there from 13 to 90 m/My (mean = 32 m/My; median = 23 m/My) and that the difference between erosion rates of basins we sampled in the two states is not significant. Sampled basin area ranges between 3 and 14,987 km2, mean basin elevation between 235 and 1606 m, and mean basin slope between 11 and 29°. Basins sampled in Rio de Janeiro, including three that drain the Serra do Mar escarpment, have an average basin slope of 19°, whereas the average slope for the Santa Catarina basins is 14°.

Goodwin:2006iluka,"Multi-centennial fluctuations in the northern New South Wales (NSW) coastline alignment are interpreted from a detailed reconstruction of the morphological and depositional evolution of the Iluka to Woody Bay barrier during the late Holocene. The regional coastline is aligned obliquely to the south-east, inner-shelf, modal wave direction, and hence sediment is transported obliquely on the shoreface with a net northward movement. On centennial to millennial time scales, the coastline is shown to have responded to fluctuations in mean wave direction, longshore gradients in sand transport and headland sand bypassing processes. Overall, barrier progradation has been punctuated by episodes of shoreline recession and realignment throughout the late Holocene. A prolonged shoreline recessional phase occurred at ~ 1500 yr BP in response to a rotation in modal wave direction from more southerly, towards east-south-easterly. Subsequent to this realignment, renewed shoreline progradation occurred along the east aspect coastline after ~ 1400 yr BP whilst the north-east aspect, coastline remained in a receded alignment until after ~ 1000 yr BP, when renewed progradation occurred. Progradation rates increased throughout the past millennium, driven by changes to the alongshore gradient in sand transport, under an implied shift to a more southerly and energetic modal wave climate. In the past 50 yrs, the north-east aspect shoreline has experienced a rapid recessional trend, which is associated with a shift in modal wave climate, to a more east-southeasterly direction, and a reduction in headland sand bypassing, The average sand supply rate to the Iluka to Woody Head section of the northern NSW shoreline is 4.1 m3/m/yr, since ~ 3000 yr BP.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

The idea of a social landscape is employed to examine how groups organise themselves on a local regional scale to meet social goals and to link these forms of organisation to the archaeological record they leave behind. The central social principle explored here is that of debt, which enjoins dispersal of materials and sets up landscapes which are non-accumulative.

Gosden:1994lolmo,"Archaeological evidence from the Bismarck Archipelago, north of Papua New Guinea (Fig. 1), has in recent years provided a sequence of change spanning the last 35,000 years (Allen and Gosden 1991). The main sets of evidence derive first from caves on New Ireland, the earliest occupation of which begins 35,000 years ago and continues down to the mid-Holocene. This is then followed by rich Lapita assemblages from open beach sites on New Britain, Mussau, and elsewhere, dating from 3500 b.p. onward. There is now a growing body of evidence spanning the period 6000 to 3500 b.p. The Lapita period is seen by many as a major point of discontinuity in the sequences from the area, because of immigration of Austronesian speakers from the west (Bellwood and Koon 1989; Kirch 1988; Spriggs 1989). However, given the increasing evidence of continuity from the pre-Lapita to the Lapita period, this hypothesis is now in need of reassessment.  The site reported here, Lolmo Cave in the Arawe Islands (Fig. 2), is important  because it spans the last 6000 years, encompassing both the Lapita period and its  immediate antecedents. The material contained in the cave provides some evidence of continuity from the pre-Lapita period through to the Lapita period,  but also some evidence of discontinuity. Lolmo Cave also represents only one  point on the landscape and does not appear to have been a major focus of habitation. In this it is similar to the few sites reported from the immediate pre-Lapita  period elsewhere, which are also caves and shelters (Spriggs 1991a).

Accelerator radiocarbon dating of particulate charcoal from discontinuous, sub-horizontal lenses within the dunes was found to produce ages inconsistent both with the chronology erected using luminescence methods and stratigraphic inferences. A combination of petrographic, SEM and XRD investigations suggests that much of the dune reddening is the result of in situ hematite crystallization within kaolinitic grain coatings, which are responsible for the high fines content of the dunes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gould:1977puntutjarpa,"Excavations at Puntutjarpa Rockshelter, in the Western Desert of Australia, reveal a continuous human occupation of this site from at least 10,000 years ago to the historic present. Analysis has stressed systematic comparisons of ethnographic Western Desert aborigine stone technology, camp sites, 'native wells,' and other archaeologically visible aspects of behavior with specific archaeological features and artifacts discovered in the excavations. Comparison also includes a preliminary assessment of paleoecological conditions based upon faunal remains and sediments deposited at the site. Although some changes are evident in the stone toolkit, these are outweighed by evidence for cultural continuities pointing to a relatively stable adaptation to rigorous post-Pleistocene conditions in the Western Desert which has continued to the present (the ethnographic Ngatatjara aborigines and other Pitjantjatjara-speaking people of the Western Desert). This stability is viewed in relation to a risk-minimizing model, in which human behavior, both ethnographically and as reflected by evidence at Puntutjarpa, is most economically explained in terms of overcoming or reducing risks inherent in obtaining basic resources in a risky environment. This adaptive model is termed the Australian desert culture. A specific discovery at Puntutjarpa of interest to Australian archaeologists is the documented occurrence of small, hafted stone scrapers (termed Micro-adzes) from the earliest dated levels there. These finds support the idea of an early appearance for the Australian 'small tool tradition,' at least with regard to this class of small tool. Backed blades and other types of small tools appeared later in the sequence, around 4000 years ago. Despite these changes in small tools, Large cores and Flake-scrapers appeared early in the sequence and continued in remarkably stable frequencies throughout. Seed-grinding activities are represented at Puntutjarpa from the earliest occupational levels to the historic period.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gould:1978james,"Excavations at the James Range East Rocksheiter in 1973 and 1974 have revealed a two-part stratigraphie sequence containing evidence of Aboriginal habitation extending back at least 5000 years from the present. The later phase of human occupation, here termed James Range II, is marked by a series of layers of dark sediment containing hearths, stone artifacts, and abundant faunal remains. Radiocarbon dates for this phase range from 2690 ± 260 B.C. to 1755 ± 80 A.D. The earlier phase of human occupation, termed James Range I, occurs in underlying layers of yellowish brown soil and red sandy soil. These soils contain stone artifacts and small amounts of butchered bone, but so far no datable hearth material has been found. On stratigraphie grounds, however, it clearly predates the James Range II phase and must be older than 5000 years. The long-range goal of this research will be to make detailed comparisons of the ecology and prehistory of the James Range East site with the archaeological and palaeoecological materials recovered at Puntutjarpa Rocksheiter in the Western Desert. Ethnographic comparisons between Central and Western Desert Aborigines reveal variability correlated with differences in habitat. In the Western Desert there are severe constraints imposed upon human settlement because of the relative scarcity and unreliability of rainfall, whereas in the Central Desert there are factors which make water resources more reliable. Ethnographically, overwhelming similarities in human adaptive behavior occur among Western and Central Desert Aborigines, but the Central Desert people consistently reveal elaborations in behavior—especially with respect to the toolkit, rock art, and aspects of social behavior—not found among Western Desert Aborigines. This essentially 'additive' relationship also occurs in the James Range East site in the form of a wider array of basic tool types and technological processes than were present contemporaneously in the Western Desert at Puntutjarpa Rockshelter. Further detailed comparisons between these two excavated sites are expected to reveal more about the nature of variability in adaptation among the Western and Central Desert Aborigines of Australia during the post-Pleistocene era. This paper reports on (1) the research objectives and strategy of the 1973 and 1974 fieldwork, (2) initial results of the archaeological excavations at the James Range East Rockshelter, Deep Well Station, Northern Territory, (3) plans for further analysis of excavated materials, and (4) some preliminary conclusions obtained to date.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gould:1982indoor,"In his 1973 review of Australian prehistory, Rhys Jones listed a total of 24 key archaeological sites, of which no less than 16 (or 67 % of the total) were rockshelters or caves. Further discussions about cave deposits in Australia occur in Bowdler (1975) and Jennings (1979). This predominance of rockshelter and cave excavations in Australia has continued, although discoveries at lo­ calities like Lake Mungo, Lancefield, and Burke‘s Cave (an open-air excavation, despite the name) reflect the growing importance of archaeological research at open-air sites. In Australia, as in other parts of the world, there are com­ pelling reasons for excavating rockshelters whenever possible, especially if one is concerned primarily with establishing local and regional stratigraphic sequences. Archaeologists everywhere have tended to take advantage of the rela­ tively protected sequential deposits contained in these kinds of sites (Jelinek 1976, 23).

Gouramanis:2012barker,"The Holocene palaeoclimatic history of south-western Western Australia (SWWA) has received little attention compared to south-eastern Australia, and this has resulted in conflicting views over the impact of climate variability in the region. We present here a well-dated, high-resolution record from two overlapping sediment cores obtained from the centre of Barker Swamp, Rottnest Island, offshore Perth. The records span the last 8.7~ka, with the main lacustrine phase occurring after 7.4~ka. This site preserves both pollen and several ostracod taxa. The pollen record suggests a long-term shift from the early-mid Holocene to the late Holocene to drier conditions with less shrubland and more low-ground cover and less fire activity. A salinity transfer function was developed from ostracod faunal assemblage data and trace metal ratios (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and Na/Ca) and stable isotopes (delta18O and delta13C) analysed on selected ostracod valves. These provide a detailed history of evaporation/precipitation (E/P) differences that clearly shows that the SWWA region was subjected to significant climatic shifts over the last 7.4~ka, with a broad shift towards increased aridity after 5~ka. The swamp ranged from fresh to saline as recorded in the ostracod valve chemistry and the independently-derived salinity transfer function. The ostracod record also indicates that a sea-level highstand occurred between ca. 4.5 and 4.3~ka, with probable step-wise increases at 6.75, 6.2, and 5.6~ka, with the last vestiges of salt water intrusion at ca. 1~ka. After about 2.3~ka, the fresh, groundwater lens that underlies the western portion of the island intersected the swamp depression, influencing the hydrology of the swamp. The broad climatic changes recorded in Barker Swamp are also compared with data from southern South Africa, and it is suggested that the Southern Annular Mode appears to have been the dominant driver in the climate of these regions and that the Indian Ocean Dipole is of little importance in the southern regions of the south-western Cape of Africa and south-western Western Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Gouramanis:2016two,"Numerous saline playa lakes exist across the arid, semiarid and temperate regions of Australia. These playa lakes exhibit a diverse range of hydrological conditions to which the Australian aquatic invertebrate biota have become adapted and which the biota can utilise as refugia in times of hydrological deterioration. Saline playas also yield palaeoenvironmental records that can be used to infer lacustrine and catchment responses to environmental variability.We present a palaeoenvironmental record recovered from Two Mile Lake, a saline playa from southern Western Australia. Dating, based on quartz optical luminescence and 14C accelerator mass spectrometry of biogenic carbonates and organic fibres, suggests that most of the sediment was rapidly deposited at 4.36  0.25 thousand years ago. Ostracods and non-marine foraminifera preserved in the sediment show periods of faunal colonisation of the lake with oscillations between hypersaline and oligosaline conditions. The geochemistry of ostracod valves and foraminifera tests suggests higher-frequency variability within the lake, and palynological changes indicate landscape changes, possibly in response to fire.

Graves:2017floodplain,"Fire plays an important role in floodplain wetlands, and wetland ecosystems respond dynamically in space and time to flooding, fire and geomorphological processes. Fire-climate-hydrology-vegetation interactions are complex and a multifaceted approach is required to understand and interpret fire history. This study investigated the use of macro-charcoal to interpret palaeo-fire regimes in the Macquarie Marshes. Sentinel Hotspot satellite data showed that Buckiinguy Swamp experienced 33 ignition points from 2002-2016, whereas Willancorah Swamp experienced 6 ignition points in this period. Macro-charcoal in contemporary sediment from Buckiinguy was used to estimate fluvial charcoal supply from upstream (13.5+/-3.2no. cm-3). Despite taking account of fluvial inputs, macro-charcoal in sediment profiles from both wetlands was highly variable. Buckiinguy had macro-charcoal up to 90 no. cm-3 in the upper 40 cm (mean charcoal accumulation rate; CHAR 0.55 cm-2a-1), and Willancorah had up to 450 no. cm-3 in the upper 60 cm (CHAR 3.75 cm-2a-1). Sedimentology, geochemistry, and carbon stable isotopes (δ13C range -15 to -25 ‰) were similar in both wetlands and quite uniform with depth. When combined with charcoal records, these proxies cannot be used with confidence to reconstruct local fire regimes.Water and wetland management could benefit from future palaeo-fire research if sufficient spatial and temporal assessment of fire and wetland conditions can be achieved.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Graves:2019macrocharcoal,"Floodplain wetland ecosystems respond dynamically to flooding, fire and geomorphological processes. We employed a combined geomorphological and environmental proxy approach to assess allochthonous and autochthonous macro-charcoal accumulation in the Macquarie Marshes, Australia, with implications for the reconstruction of fire regimes and environmental conditions in large, open-system wetlands. After accounting for fluvial macro-charcoal flux (1.05 +/- 0.32 no. cm-2 a-1), autochthonous macro-charcoal in ~1 m deep sediment profiles spanning ~1.7 ka were highly variable and inconsistent between cores and wetlands (concentrations from 0 to 438 no. cm-3, mean accumulation rates from 0 to 3.86 no. cm-2 a-1). A positive correlation existed between the number of recent fires, satellite-observed ignition points, and macro-charcoal concentrations at the surface of the wetlands. Sedimentology, geochemistry, and carbon stable isotopes (δ13C range -15 to -25 ‰) were similar in all cores from both wetlands and varied little with depth. Application of macro-charcoal and other environmental proxy techniques is inherently difficult in large, dynamic wetland systems due to variations in charcoal sources, sediment and charcoal deposition rates, and taphonomic processes. Major problems facing fire history reconstruction using macro-charcoal records in these wetlands include: (1) spatial and temporal variations in fire activity and ash and charcoal products within the wetlands, (2) variations in allochthonous inputs of charcoal from upstream sources, (3) tendency for geomorphic dynamism to affect flow dispersal and sediment and charcoal accumulation, and (4) propensity for post-depositional modification and/or destruction of macro-charcoal by flooding and taphonomic processes. Recognition of complex fire-climate-hydrology-vegetation interactions is essential.

Gray:2016benefits,"The endangered black-tailed dusky antechinus (Antechinus arktos) was described in 2014, so most aspects of its ecology are unknown. We examined diet composition and prey selection of A. arktos and a sympatric congener, the northern form of A. stuartii, at two sites in Springbrook National Park. Overall, taxa from 25 invertebrate orders were identified in the diets from 252 scat samples. Dietary components were similar for each species, but A. arktos consumed a higher frequency and volume of dipteran larvae and Diplopoda, while A. stuartii consumed more Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and Isopoda. Both species of Antechinus had a higher percentage of ‘empty’ scats (devoid of any identifiable invertebrate material) in 2014 compared with 2015. The former was a drier year overall. Lower rainfall may have reduced abundance and diversity of arthropod prey, causing both species to supplement their diet with soft-bodied prey items such as earthworms, which are rarely detected in scats. Comparison of prey in scats with invertebrate captures from pitfall traps showed both species to be dietary generalists, despite exhibiting distinct preference and avoidance of certain prey categories. The ability of an endangered generalist marsupial to switch prey may be particularly advantageous considering the anticipated effects of climate change on Gondwanan rainforests during the mid-late 21st century.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,

GrelletTinner:2016dreamtime,"The iconic Australian Genyornis newtoni (Dromornithidae, Aves) is the sole Pleistocene member of an avian clade now hypothesized to be alternatively in Anseriformes or the sister group of crown Galloanseres. A distinctive type of fossil eggshell commonly found in eroding sand dunes, has been referred to Genyornis newtoni since the 1980s. The 126 by 97~mm Spooner Egg, dated at 54.7~±~3.1 ka by optical dating of its enclosing sediments, is a complete specimen of this eggshell type that was reconstructed from fragments of a broken egg. We show that the size of the eggs from which this 'Genyornis' eggshell derives, either as predicted from measurements of fragments, or as indicated by the Spooner Egg, is unexpectedly small given the size of G. newtoni, which has an estimated mass of 275~kg, or about seven times the mass of the emu that has a similar sized egg. We compared the microstructure of the putative Genyornis eggshell to that of other dromornithids and a range of galloanseriform taxa using several microcharacterisation techniques. The 'Genyornis' eggshell displays a mosaic of oological characters that do not unambiguously support referral to any known modern bird. Its shell structure, coupled with chemical compounds in the accessory layer, makes it unlikely to have been laid by a dromornithid, whereas several characters support a megapode origin. A potential candidate for the bird that laid the putative 'Genyornis' eggs in the Pleistocene fossil avifaunal record has been ignored: Progura, a genus of extinct giant megapodes, whose species were widespread in Australia. Regression of egg size of megapodes and body mass shows that the Spooner Egg approximates the expected size for eggs laid by species of Progura. We advance the suggestion that the fossil eggshell hitherto referred to Genyornis newtoni, is more likely to have been laid by species of the giant extinct Progura. As megapodes, the species of Progura were obligate ectothermic incubators, which we suggest laid their eggs into a hole dug in sand like the modern megapode Macrocephalon maleo, thus explaining the abundant 'Genyornis' eggshell in sand dunes. Referral of this eggshell to Progura means that the fossil record of Genyornis newtoni is limited to bones and the timing of the extinction of this last dromornithid is unknown. In addition, structural similarities of eggshell in megapodes, the putative Genyornis eggshell and dromornithids, raise the possibility that these taxa are phylogenetically more closely related to each other than any is to anseriforms. Specifically, this means that dromornithids might be a sister group to galliforms rather than to or within anseriforms.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Samples distributed along 140 km of the main Vakhsh River yield denudation rates between 1.28 ± 0.16 to 1.94 ± 0.26 mm/yr. In detail, samples from rivers draining the Northern Pamir indicate denudation rates of ~1.7 mm/yr, and a river draining the Alai Valley indicates denudation rates of 1.14 ± 0.14 mm/yr. In contrast, rivers draining the Western Tian Shan show increasing denudation rates from 0.18 ± 0.02 mm/yr in the west to 2.70 ± 0.36 mm/yr in the east, coincident with a small increase in the fluvial normalized steepness index (ksn).

Analysis of in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be from depth profiles collected from a sequence of terraces preserved along the main trunk of the Vakhsh River indicate terrace incision starting at ~3 kyr as well as paleo-denudation rates ranging between 1.75 ± 0.54 to 2.01 ± 0.39 mm/yr (2 s.d. errors). All these results suggest consistent high denudation rates in the Northern Pamir block, and a spatial (along strike) gradient in Western Tian Shan denudation rates. The most likely explanation for the spatial gradient in Western Tian Shan and Vakhsh River denudation rates is a regional gradient in tectonic rock uplift.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Most studies were limited to samples from modern active streams, thus little is known about the magnitude and causes of TCN variability on millennial time scales. In this work we present a 6 kyrs long, high resolution record of 10Be concentrations (n  = 18), which were measured in sediment cores from an alluvial fan delta at the outlet of the Fedoz Valley in the Swiss Alps. This record is paired with a 3‐year time series (n  = 4) of 10Be measured in sediment from the active stream currently feeding this fan delta. The temporal trend in the 10Be concentrations after correction for postdepositional production of 10Be was found to be overall constant and in good agreement with the modern river 10Be concentration. ...

Groube:1986huon,"The geographical position of the island of New Guinea suggests that it may have been an early staging post in the Pleistocene settlement of Australia from the Indonesia-Indochina region. Previous data have not supported this, as archaeological sites 35,000 to 40,000 years old occur in southern Australia, whereas the earliest previously known in Papua New Guinea is 26,000 years old. We now report evidence that the north coast of Papua New Guinea was occupied at least 40,000 years ago. Sahuland, which is the greater land area of Australia and New Guinea plus their connecting continental shelf exposed as land when Pleistocene sea levels were lower than now, was occupied by humans in several widely separated areas at that time. A distinctive ‘waisted axe‘ culture appears to have existed in New Guinea and probably in Australia in the Late Pleistocene, but antecedents are not yet known from east and southeast Asia.

Grun:2001naracoorte,"The caves near Naracoorte, South Australia, contain one of the richest and most diverse fossil faunal assemblages on the Australian continent. Three sites were selected for electron spin resonance (ESR) dating because clastic, fossiliferous sediments were sandwiched between speleothem layers. This allows independent age control by highly precise thermal ionization mass-spectrometry (TIMS) U-series dating. We find that all ESR results agree within the constraints given by the U-series dates, and allow further refinement of the age of the fauna analysed, indicating that most of the fauna in the large Victoria Cave Fossil Chamber is twice as old as reported previously. Our dating results, spanning from 280 to 500 ka for the Fossil Chamber, Victoria Cave, to about 125 ka for the Grant Hall, Victoria Cave, and 170 to 280 ka for the Fossil Chamber, Cathedral Cave, indicate little change, if any in the megafaunal assemblage from the early Middle to the early Late Pleistocene.

Grun:2008electron,"In recent years, there has been much debate about the timing of the Late Pleistocene extinction of the Australian megafauna. Some studies postulated a rapid, continental-wide extinction at around 46 000 years ago and that the arrival of humans in Australia, rather than climatic fluctuations, was the main cause for the demise of the megafauna. We have applied electron spin resonance (ESR) dating to a series of teeth from megafauna sites in South Australia, where young ages were expected. During this study, a number of unexpected problems were encountered. These were mainly related to the fact that ESR age assessments on fossil teeth are critically dependent on a realistic reconstruction of the post-mortem uranium uptake into the dental tissues. At virtually all sites, conventional, routine ESR dating, based on the parametric early and linear U-uptake models, would have led to grossly erroneous results. Most teeth were analysed for U-series isotopes with laser ablation ICP-MS, and the results were used to calculate combined U-series ESR age estimates. Only one of the 24 teeth analysed conformed to the commonly applied early and linear U-uptake models. At one of the sites, we found for the first time clear evidence of uranium leaching from dentine. Detailed laser ablation scans revealed that, in contrast to large mammals outside Australia, marsupial tooth enamel does not seem to contain a barrier layer close to the outer surface that blocks uranium diffusion into the enamel. As a consequence, uranium migrates into the enamel layer from both the outside and the inside via the dentine, which makes marsupial teeth generally less well suited for ESR dating. It was particularly difficult to obtain age estimates for the site of Black Creek Swamp, where the sediments contained extreme U-series disequilibrium, and the teeth had unexpectedly accumulated very high U-concentrations (up to 700 ppm in dentine) within a few thousand years. Although most of the sites contained reworked teeth, none of the samples yielded age estimates that were significantly younger than the proposed extinction window of about 40 000-51 000 years.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Grun:2010cuddie,"The timing and cause of late Pleistocene faunal extinctions in Australia are subjects of a debate that has become polarised by two vigorously defended views. One contends that the late Pleistocene extinction was a short event caused by humans colonising the Australian continent, whereas the other promotes a gradual demise of the fauna, over a period of at least 10-20ka, due to a combination of climatic changes and ecological pressures by humans. Cuddie Springs is central to this debate as it is the only site known in continental Australia where archaeological and megafauna remains co-occur. We have analysed more than 60 bones and teeth from the site by laser ablation ICP-MS to determine U, and Th concentrations and distributions, and those with sufficiently high U concentrations were analysed for U-series isotopes. Twenty-nine teeth were analysed by ESR. These new results, as well as previously published geochronological data, contradict the hypothesis that the clastic sediments of Stratigraphic Unit 6 (SU6) are in primary context with the faunal, archaeological and other materials found in SU6, and that all have ages consistent with the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) estimates of 30-36ka. These young OSL results were used to argue for a relatively recent age of the extinct fauna. Our results imply that SU6 is either significantly older than the OSL results, or that a large fraction of the faunal material and the charcoal found in SU6 was derived from older, lateral deposits. Our U and Th laser ablation ICPMS results as well as the REE profiles reported by Trueman et~al. [2008. Comparing rates of recystallisation and the potential for preservation of biomolecules from the distribution of trace elements in fossil bones. C.R. Palevol.

Gudmundsdottir:2013cruz,"Reverse faults frequently generate large and destructive earthquakes, yet their seismic hazard remains difficult to assess with traditional paleoseismic tools because their surface expressions are often complex and subtle. This contribution assesses the utility of millennial-scale denudation rates derived from in-situ cosmogenic 10Be for revealing the spatial patterns and magnitudes of rock uplift produced by slip along reverse faults. We present seventeen basin-averaged denudation rates from rivers draining the Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Andreas fault (California, USA) which closely reproduce known uplift rate patterns associated with a restraining bend along the fault. An additional component of vertical deformation appears to be superposed on the uplift due to the restraining bend; this may result from regional transpression, further irregularities in the fault trace, or interactions with neighboring faults. Our results indicate that 10Be-derived denudation rates can reveal patterns of rock uplift adjacent to reverse faults over length-scales relevant for characterizing their seismic hazard potential.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Guimaraes:2021chur,"We used concentrations of in situ cosmogenic 10Be from riverine sediment to quantify the basin-averaged denudation rates and sediment fluxes in the Plessur Basin, Eastern Swiss Alps, which is a tributary stream to the Alpine Rhine, one of the largest streams in Europe. We complement the cosmogenic dataset with the results of morphometric analyses, geomorphic mapping, and sediment fingerprinting techniques. The results reveal that the Plessur Basin is still adjusting to the landscape perturbation caused by the glacial carving during the Last Glacial Maximum c. 20,000 years ago. This adjustment has been most efficient in the downstream part where the bedrock comprises high erodibility North Penninic flysch and Bündnerschist, whereas glacial landforms are still prominently preserved in the upstream region, comprising low erodibility South Penninic and Austroalpine bedrock. This geomorphic observation is supported by the 10Be based denudation rate and sediment provenance analysis, which indicate a much faster sediment production in the flysch and schist lithologies. Interestingly, the reach of fast denudation has experienced the highest exhumation and rock uplift rates. This suggests that lithologic and glacial conditioning have substantially contributed to the local uplift and denudation as some of the driving forces of a positive feedback system.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Guralnik:2010pavements,"Early to late Pleistocene 10Be exposure ages of abandoned surfaces in the Negev desert reveal the regional drainage evolution history and its relationship with the subsidence of the western margin of the Dead Sea Rift. The dated desert paved surfaces have developed over originally westward-flowing rivers, which were abandoned by early Pleistocene and whose relicts are now progressively tilted towards the rift axis. The slow and non-destructive subsidence coupled with extreme hyperaridity enabled the preservation of these ancient surfaces along some of the main water divides in the Negev, nearly irrespective of their distance from the rift axis. Constraints on the tilting history are obtained from analyzing the spatial pattern of the exposure ages, suggesting subsidence rates as low as 120–300 m Ma–1 in the southern Arava Valley since the late Pliocene. It is shown that the transition from the Pliocene to current drainage pattern occurred over a short period during the early Pleistocene, and that the governing fluvial response that followed the delineation of current basins is represented by a continuous spectrum of ages of inset terraces.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Guse:2005home,"The Reynolds River region contributes significantly to the natural and cultural heritage of the Northern   Territory. This thesis documents the Aboriginal heritage places of the Reynolds River, using current heritage methodologies to determine the appropriateness of the current regime of legislation and practices. The suite of cultural heritage places in the Reynolds River region demonstrates the continuous and large-scale occupation by Aboriginal people of the region from the beginning of the Holocene through to the present. These sites also reflect the many changes that were occurring in the natural environment and ecology over the last 3000 years. Geomorphic changes culminated in the creation of the freshwater wetlands that are a fundamental part of the Werat traditional owner’s cultural landscape. The wetlands, and their flora and fauna, feature significantly in Werat mythology and beliefs and have always been an important economic source. This thesis attempts to document archaeological sites and the cultural significance these places have to Werat traditional owners. Heritage places in the Reynolds River area are of national significance as they are representative of, and can contribute significantly to our understanding of, the intensification of the diverse activities undertaken by Aboriginal people in the past. Many of these cultural heritage places are under threat from natural, animal and human agents with the distinct possibility of significantly diminishing the heritage values if left unchecked. This thesis demonstrates that when applying the current suite of Territory and Commonwealth legislation to Indigenous heritage places of the Reynolds River region, blanket protection cannot be afforded to all values if they are not attached to an archaeological or sacred site. Consequently, with varying degrees of protection come varying degrees of ability for Aboriginal traditional owners to conserve and protect their heritage places.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The points in the assemblage consist of a complex mixture of whole and fragmented points in all phases of production. The fragmentation degree is high; approximately 80% of the points are broken. A high proportion of bending fractures shows that several of the points were discarded due to production failures, and points with impact damage or hafting traces show that used points were left in the cave. This illustrates that the production of points as well as replacement of used points took place at the site. The result also shows that worked but not finished preforms and points were left at the site, suggestive of future preparation. ...",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,

Today, these floodplain remnants are deeply entrenched and laterally eroded by ephemeral traction load streams. The north-south aligned ranges are strategically situated within the present-day transitional zone, receiving both topographically enhanced winter rainfall from the SW and convectional downpours from summer monsoonal incursions from the north. We develop a regional chronostratigraphy of depositional and erosional events emphasizing the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Based on 124 ages (94 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon and 30 optically stimulated luminescence) from the most significant terrace remnants on both sides of the Ranges, we conclude that the last glacial cycle including the LGM was characterized by major environmental changes. Two pronounced periods of pedogenesis between c. 36 and 30 ka were followed by widespread erosion and reworking. A short-lived interval of climatic stability before c. 24 ka was followed by conditions in which large amounts of proximal dust (loess) were deposited across the catchments. These loess mantles were rapidly redistributed and episodically transported downstream by floods.

Three distinct episodes of landscape change in the Arona Valley and Noreikora basin can be interpreted from the palaeoecological records: (1) by 4500 BP erosion of catchment sediments, possibly due to vegetation disturbance by human activity, led to the formation and extension of swamplands in valley bottoms; (2) after 4500 BP the newly expanded wetland environments were exploited for resources, such as Pandanus and wood, with their eventual clearance and establishment of extensive grasslands by 1350 BP; and (3) an adaptation to this treeless environment appears in the form of Casuarina arboriculture by 600 BP and a further intensification of agricultural activity occurs after 230 BP. Comparison of palaeoecological records from the eastern highlands with sites further to the west show similar changes over the last 4500 years that have been related to widespread developments in agricultural techniques and to the introduction of new crops in the highlands.

Haberle:1998tari,"The changes in Late Quaternary vegetation at two sites in the Tari Basin, central highlands of New Guinea, are presented. Haeapugua basin (1650 m altitude) and Tugupugua basin (2300 m altitude) lie within the lower montane forest belt, where the climate is characterised by high relative humidity and low seasonality. Pollen analysis, mineral magnetics, carbonised particle analysis, and dating by radiocarbon and thermoluminescence techniques are employed to reconstruct the vegetation and sediment history. The sequences include fragmentary interglacial/interstadial records from before 50,000 yr B.P. and a continuous record from at least 28,000 yr B.P. to the present. The study shows that, prior to 21,000 yr B.P., vegetation in the basin was dominated by fluctuating proportions of tree taxa indicative of a forested environment. The montane forest taxon, Nothofagus, is important throughout the record, although other tree taxa, including Castanopsis, Myrtaceae, Dacrydium and Pandanus, attain dominance at different times under the influence of a range of environmental factors. The creation of an open environment around 21,000 yr B.P. is considered to be a consequence of the arrival of humans in the region. The late glacial transition, between 14,500 and 8500 yr B.P., is a period of climatic instability with landscape and vegetation adjustments proceeding at different rates across the highlands. Vegetational adjustments match modern ranges by about 8500 yr B.P., when swamp forest developed across the sites. At the lower altitude site there are indications of anthropogenic forest disturbance, associated with swamp forest clearance, commencing around 1700 yr B.P. and intensifying through to the present. Forest clearance is recorded only after 700 yr B.P. at the higher site, where agriculture was probably only sustainable after the introduction of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas).",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Despite the presence of humans in the region throughout the last 20,000 years, there is no suggestion that, on a regional spatial scale, fire frequencies were solely related to changing subsistence patterns of the human population. Pollen data from these same sites suggest that during times of high charcoal the rate at which vegetation changes, represented by the fossil pollen spectra, also increases. High climate variability may promote a greater community turnover rate and in turn a more fire susceptible forest community. Rapid climate change and high variability during the last glacial transition and intensification of El Niño-related climate variability during the middle to late Holocene, may have been important mechanisms for promoting fire in rainforest environments and maintaining diversity of tropical rain forests.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Haberle:2001correlations,"Microscopic charcoal preserved in lake and swamp sediments from 10 sites in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and from 5 sites in Central and South America have been used to reconstruct long-term fire histories for these two regions. Comparison of these records demonstrates that fire is promoted during periods of rapid climate change and high climate variability, regardless of the presence or absence of humans. Broad synchrony of changes in corrected charcoal values in each region supports an atmospheric transmission of the climate signal via the dominant large-scale atmospheric circulation systems (Walker Circulation) that appears to have persisted since 16,000 cal yr B.P. Altered climate boundary conditions under the influence of changing El Niño-related variability, insolation, sea level, and sea surface temperature all influenced the strength of this connection. Correlation of biomass burning records between the regions tends to increase in the Holocene. The main period of inverse correlation occurs during the Younger Dryas Stade, when extratropical climate most affected the tropics. The strongest correlation between the two regions postdates 5000 cal yr B.P., when El Niño-related variability intensified.

An evaluation of the change in biodiversity of forest habitats through the Late Glacial transition to the present in five palaeoecological sites from highland valleys, where intensive agriculture is practised today, is presented. A detailed analysis of the longest and most continuous record from Papua New Guinea is also presented using available biodiversity indices (palynological richness and biodiversity indicator taxa) as a means of identifying changes in diversity. The analysis shows that the collapse of key forest habitats in the highland valleys is evident during the Mid--Late Holocene.

These events led to fears that repeated large fires in the future may lead to large changes in the distribution of rainforest and sclerophyll (trees and shrubs with hard leaves adapted mainly to dry climate) communities in northern Australia. There is growing recognition that a greater understanding of the role of fire in the environment is needed, and can be gained through the study of the frequency and impact of past fire events (Lynch et al., 2007; Bowman et al., 2009).",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Samples collected from exposed stratigraphic sections associated with archaeological excavations enable detailed reconstructions of local vegetation and fire histories that can be directly linked to archaeological evidence for agricultural activity. The record of past environmental change is constructed through detailed chronological control and stratigraphic correlation across the swamp, revealing evidence of early Holocene vegetation disturbance including short-term, patchy forest loss and burning considered indicative of plant exploitation. It is not until the mid-Holocene (after 7000 cal BP) that persistent and widespread forest loss occurs, with burning and the transplanting of Musa banana into an open grassland environment, which is contemporary with local archaeological features representing cultivation practices. Multi-proxy palaeoecological evidence at Kuk provides a robust vegetation history and land use chronology for the Upper Wahgi Valley for the late Pleistocene and Holocene, including the emergence of an agricultural landscape by 7000 cal BP.

Haenfling:2015masters,"Subfossil plant cuticles, the very resistant waxy layer covering vascular land plants, are a neglected source of information in peat studies, despite their high preservation and identification potential. A lack of standardised methods and reference material are major contributing factors. In this thesis, a new method is introduced to test if subfossil plant cuticles from Moanatuatua Bog in the northern North Island of New Zealand can give a robust reconstruction of local bog surface vegetation changes during the Holocene. The method was successfully established and applied at coarse sampling resolution to show vegetation changes across the full length of the core and at fine sampling resolution around charcoal layers to reconstruct the post-fire response pattern of the main plant species on the bog. Additionally, bulk density and organic matter analyses were carried out to provide further insight into these changes. At the core site, towards the southern margins of Moanatuatua Bog, swamp forest had developed by 15000 cal yr BP. Until ca. 10500 cal yr BP, the vegetation assemblage was sedge-dominated, indicating swamp and/or fen conditions. A significant increase in macroscopic charcoal particles coincided with the transition to a more diversified vegetation composition. At around 4500 cal yr BP, the vegetation became restiad-dominated, indicating full raised bog conditions. The coarse resolution cuticle results were further compared to a pollen record from the same sequence, which was established independently. This comparison showed that plant subfossil cuticles can provide additional information to pollen analysis in cases where pollen is hard to identify or poorly preserved. Specifically, restiad pollen is hard to differentiate, yet cuticles of Empodisma and Sporadanthus have very distinct features. Also, Cyperaceae pollen is very poorly preserved at Moanatuatua Bog and the Cyperaceae pollen curve shows a poor match with the Cyperaceae cuticle record. It is suggested therefore that Cyperaceae pollen at this site -- and potentially other peat sites -- is a less reliable indicator of local sedge communities than a Cyperaceae cuticle record. At fine resolution, results were blurred across a time interval that was marginal for reconstructing response patterns due to the constraints imposed by sampling resolution and peat accumulation rate of Moanatuatua Bog. Nevertheless, two out of three charcoal layers recorded a local fire on the bog surface, with one layer displaying the expected vegetation response. After the fire, Empodisma, as a mid-successional species, re-established on the bog surface before Sporadanthus, a late-successional species. The other layer was dominated by sedges and showed no response pattern, as is to be expected due to the very fast recovery of sedges. In general, sample preparation for cuticle analysis proved to be fast with relatively little equipment or chemicals needed. With detailed reference material, identification to species level is possible due to distinctive and pronounced cuticle features. Plant cuticle analysis is therefore proposed to be a reliable tool to reconstruct long-term and short-term vegetation changes from peat sequences.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Haenfling:2017cuticles,"We present a method for analysing subfossil plant cuticles preserved in peat and apply the method to provide a preliminary, coarse resolution reconstruction of Holocene vegetation history at Moanatuatua Bog, northern North Island, New Zealand. The plant cuticle record reveals the early-Holocene development of a swamp and its transition to a raised bog, which is not apparent from other proxies. Comparison with a pollen record from the same sequence highlights the advantages of plant cuticle analysis in cases where pollen is hard to identify or poorly preserved. In particular, distinguishing between the pollen grains of the two main bog species, the restiads Empodisma robustum and Sporadanthus ferrugineus, relies on subtle gradational characteristics, whereas their cuticular patterns are very distinct. Furthermore, Cyperaceae pollen is poorly preserved at Moanatuatua Bog, being almost completely absent, whereas the Cyperaceae cuticles are present throughout the sequence. Therefore, we suggest that Cyperaceae pollen at this site is a less reliable indicator of local sedge communities than the cuticle record. The wide dispersal capabilities of these wind-dispersed pollen types also make them less suitable for determining local site vegetation and environmental change in comparison with cuticle remains. These results suggest that plant cuticle analysis may be a useful tool for the reconstruction of long-term vegetation changes from peat sequences, especially when used in concert with palynology.

Hall:1980minner,"During four days in August 1978 an exploratory excavation was undertaken on the east coast of Moreton Island by prehistory students of the University of Queensland under the direction of this writer. It was during this year that Moreton Island was selected for intensive archaeological research. This decision was based on the fact that the island is possessed of a relatively undisturbed environment. Thus, it has the potential of yielding an archaeologically complete subsistence settlement system which might be used as a model for other islands in the Moreton Bay region (e.g. Stradbroke Island) whose archaeological records are relatively incomplete due to European settlement and subsequent development. The project was initiated at two levels which included systematic survey and selected excavation programs. The explicit aim of the excavation reported herein was threefold. First, it was designed to collect specific data concerning one component of a general subsistence settlement model generated by previous results of a survey undertaken by the Archaeology Branch, D.A.I.A., in1975, which held that prehistoric populations on Moreton Island were primarily located on the coasts due to a dependance upon marine resources (Morwood nd a., nd b.). Secondly it sought to gather samples suitable for radiocarbon dating in order to gain a temporal insight into the island‘s occupation. Thirdly, the excavation was designed as a practical fieldwork exercise for second-year anthropology students enroled in the AY201 course (Archaeology-Prehistory Basic). Materials excavated by them were to be analysed in the laboratory component of the course, thereby allowing coherence of study.

Hall:1984toulkerrie,"A systematic archaeological investigation of Moreton Island commenced in 1978 as the offshore component of the First stage of The Moreton Region Archaeological Project (MRAP) (see Hall 1980a). Although two previous archaeological surveys had been undertaken on the island (Ponosov 1964, Morwood n.d.), neither had attempted to cover it in a systematic and comprehensive manner. Both had essentially recorded sites close to the shores. Consequently, in order to achieve initial aims of MRAP concerning the variability of the archaeological record across the whole of the island‘s landscape, it was necessary to carry out a systematic survey. This was accomplished by Richard Robins as part of his M.A. degree research (Robins 1983 and 1984a this volume). However, during the initial reconnaissance which preceded this survey, a small number of sites were noted as having potential for answering basic questions outlined MRAP‘s research design. The first of these concerned chronology; just how long have people been exploiting the offshore islands of Moreton Bay? It was also important to know the relative contemporaneity of various types of sites on the island. Hence, sites which exhibited stratigraphic integrity were sought. A second question at that time concerned the nature of the subsistence aspect of the prehistoric economy. Hence it was important to choose sites in differing localities and which exhibited different faunal and artefactual components. Consequently, exploratory excavations were undertaken at roughly the same time as the survey.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

At that time I was mainly interested in developing a regional chronology and thus sought sites which promised deeply stratified cultural deposits. Two subsequent visits to the site in 1981 confirmed initial positive impressions and exploratory excavation was undertaken between 3-10 February 1982.

Hamm:2016megafauna,"Warratyi rock shelter shows evidence of human occupation approximately 50,000 years ago, development of tool use and cultural innovation, and interaction with now-extinct megafauna in arid Australia. Modern humans had made landfall in Australia by 50,000 years ago. But there has been some doubt as to whether or when they had the technological sophistication to tackle the arid central regions of that driest of continents. The answer is that they had, and that they made short work of it. Giles Hamm et al. report the earliest known occurrence of human occupation in the arid interior of Australia, at a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia around 49,000 years ago. The various layers of rock at the site document the earliest known use in Australia of technologies such as bone tools and backed flakes, and of red ochre and gypsum as pigments. The site also preserves evidence of the presence of the large marsupial Diprotodon optatum and what are thought to be eggshells of the giant bird Genyornis newtoni. This is the only reliably dated, stratified record of extinct Australian megafauna alongside artefacts more than 46,000 years old. Elucidating the material culture of early people in arid Australia and the nature of their environmental interactions is essential for understanding the adaptability of populations and the potential causes of megafaunal extinctions 50–40 thousand years ago (ka). Humans colonized the continent by 50 ka1,2, but an apparent lack of cultural innovations compared to people in Europe and Africa3,4 has been deemed a barrier to early settlement in the extensive arid zone2,3. Here we present evidence from Warratyi rock shelter in the southern interior that shows that humans occupied arid Australia by around 49 ka, 10 thousand years (kyr) earlier than previously reported2. The site preserves the only reliably dated, stratified evidence of extinct Australian megafauna5,6, including the giant marsupial Diprotodon optatum, alongside artefacts more than 46 kyr old. We also report on the earliest-known use of ochre in Australia and Southeast Asia (at or before 49–46 ka), gypsum pigment (40–33 ka), bone tools (40–38 ka), hafted tools (38–35 ka), and backed artefacts (30–24 ka), each up to 10 kyr older than any other known occurrence7,8. Thus, our evidence shows that people not only settled in the arid interior within a few millennia of entering the continent9, but also developed key technologies much earlier than previously recorded for Australia and Southeast Asia8.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Hanson:2023rainbow,"The Great Sandy National Park [K'gari (Fraser Island) and Cooloola] contains the largest subtropical patterned fen complexes in the world. These globally significant, groundwater-dependent ecosystems have been previously studied in relatively undisturbed areas on K'gari and were suggested to be resilient to changes in hydrology, sea level and wildfires. The Rainbow Beach patterned fens are under-studied systems thought to be formed in local perched aquifers. The palaeoenvironmental conditions required for the formation and continuation of these peatlands, and how they react to changes in hydroclimate, sea level and human activities are uncertain. We attempt to resolve this ambiguity using proxies for vegetation and environmental changes over the last ~12,770 cal yr BP from a sediment core located in the Rainbow Beach patterned fen complex. We infer the formation of an aquitard layer and Empodisma minus mire development at ~12,770 cal yr BP, with conditions conducive for patterning ~12,000--10,000 cal yr BP. Paludification occurred in the early Holocene, coincident with increased sea levels, which expanded the mire inland. Increased salt marsh taxa during this period coincides with decreased E. minus values, while further peatland development occurred ~4200 cal yr BP, suggesting that marine influences greatly effect these coastal peatlands. Evidence of vegetation thickening associated with post-European fire suppression was observed. Compared to those on K'gari, the Rainbow Beach complex appears to have initiated through different processes and show greater sensitivity to changes in sea levels. Therefore, subtropical patterned fens should be assessed independently to identify individual trajectories and sensitivities.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Tributary channels to the Yellow River display systematic downstream increases in channel gradient associated with convex upward longitudinal profiles. Steep lower reaches of channels are associated with rapid (>1 m/ka) incision rates along the Yellow River, while upstream reaches are associated with relatively slow (0.05-0.1 m/ka) erosion of soil-mantled uplands. Covariance between erosion rates and channel steepness indices suggest that channels are adjusted to match long-wavelength differential rock uplift across the range. Geologic constraints indicate that rapid incision downstream of the range is associated with excavation of basin fill driven by changes in relative base level farther downstream.  ...

The pollen record covers at least the last 9000 years and reveals changes in the bog and in the surrounding vegetation, although pollen percentages of N. cunninghamii are sufficiently high to indicate that the species could have had a local presence throughout the recorded period. It is likely that this N. cunninghamii stand is relictual, surviving not only Holocene climates, but also the cool dry conditions of the last glacial period. This ability to survive changing and sometimes very unfavourable climates leads to the conclusion that great caution must be exercised in using present climates alone to predict the potential distribution of N. cunninghamii.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Of crucial importance has been the estimation of ages for two major pre-Holocene phases of forest expansion recorded in the sequence, with implications for the timing of periods of high effective precipitation in the region. The new UTD ages indicate that the oldest forest phase falls within the Penultimate Interglacial whereas the later phase corresponds with the Last Interglacial. This is older than indicated by previously reported UTD and radiocarbon dates, but confirms a chronology based on direct correlation with the pollen record from marine core E55-6. The new chronology of the Lake Wangoom sequence provides evidence that phases of sustained forest development in southeast Australia relate to interglacial periods. In comparison, interstadial periods appear to be characterised by only minor arboreal development. Marked differences in the pattern of vegetation development evident in each of the interglacials are thought to reflect varying climatic and anthropogenic influences.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Close agreement between paired OCR and I4C determinations from Wilinyjibari suggest that with further research, the OCR carbon dating procedure may have potential applications to both pre- and post-contact archaeological sites in Australia, particularly sites with little organic carbon from which to derive radiometric carbon dates.

The excavations revealed an almost continuous sequence of archaeological sites dating between 5250calBP and 50calBP years. These include some of the earliest and latest radiocarbon ages associated with Anadara granosa dominated middens, shell mounds and earth mounds from northwestern Australia. Where earlier researchers had suggested that Anadara exploitation in northwestern Australia, and particularly on the Abydos plain and Burrup Peninsula, was limited to between 4200 and 1600 BP, these excavations demonstrate that the exploitation of Anadara shell in the Port Hedland region was continuous from at least 4400calBP (and possibly as early as 5350calBP) until the early twentieth century. Based on a consideration of their contents and ages, it is suggested that the various forms of shell accumulations in the study area, including shell mounds, earth mounds, surface scatters and stratified lenses of shell midden, are likely to vary more as a result of site formation processes than Aboriginal people's past gathering practices. This finding has broader implications for understanding the place of Anadara shell mounds and middens in the prehistoric regional economy of northwestern Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The motivating problem is the establishment of a chronology for samples taken from lake sediment cores, i.e. the attribution of a set of dates to samples of the core given their depths, knowing that the age--depth relationship is monotone.

Hattanji:2019ashio,"Total and continuing denudation rates were estimated using cosmogenic nuclides and intensive field observations of sediment transport in two small basins (C3 and S3) from the Ashio Mountains, Japan. The C3 basin underlain by Triassic bedded chert, while the S3 basin has evolved in altered Jurassic sandstone-shale. Continuing denudation rates were estimated from the records of coarse sediment transport and stream discharge for 6 years (2004–2009), soil grain-size distribution, and dissolved load in stream water. A debris flow was observed and the volume was measured in C3 (chert). Concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in fluvial sand were measured to determine spatially-averaged total denudation rates for these basins on the basis of steady-state assumption. Continuing denudation rate for C3 (chert) basin excluding the debris-flow mass accounted for ~75\% of the total denudation rate as measured from the cosmogenic nuclides. Assuming a difference between the total and continuing denudation rates indicates the impact of repeat debris flows, the debris flows with the observed magnitude (the mass of 24 t) occur with the recurrence intervals of 100–550 years (mean 167 years) for C3 (chert) basin. For S3 (sandstone) basin, the continuous denudation rates were significantly smaller than the total rates, where debris flow had not occurred for at least 17 years. The large gap in the denudation rates with different time scales shows contribution of higher magnitude debris-flow events with longer recurrence intervals.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The dugong bones have recently been dated, giving a conventional 14C age of 5520±70 years BP, which is consistent with three older 14C dates for a layer of buried trees that underlies much of the north Botany sediments. The carefully drawn cross-sections of depositional strata produced by the original discoverers allow further interpretation of the pattern of Holocene sea-level fluctuations in the Sydney region. Layers of estuarine sediment, such as the one containing the dugong skeleton, are inter-bedded with peat layers containing in situ roots and stumps, suggesting that the site alternated between sub-aerial exposure and submergence throughout the Holocene. ...

Hazell:2004thesis,"A selection of palaeoecological proxies were tested on two raised, ombrotrophic, restiad peat bog sites from the North Island of New Zealand. With varying degrees of success, peat humification, testate amoebae, plant macrofossil and charcoal analyses contributed to determining the palaeomoisture records from three cores on each site. Climatic inferences have successfully been made for the Waikato region, mid North Island, over the period between the Tuhua (6,130±30 14C years BP; 6,800-7,150 cal. years BP) and Taupo (1,850±10 14C years BP; 1,650-1,800 cal. years BP) tephras. 47 AMS radiocarbon ages contributed to the production of age-depth models. The peat humification records have a resolution of 20-30 years and are the first replicated records for this region. Whilst peat humification and charcoal were the most successful analyses, the limited plant macrofossil work has also shown potential. Testate amoebae analysis, however, was not appropriate for these particular sites due to extremely low fossil test abundances. From the peat humification record, the main palaeomoisture trend identified in all cores is a shift towards wetter conditions c.5,000-4,000 cal. years BP. This is thought to have resulted from stronger westerly circulation, driven by increasing temperature and pressure gradients across the Southern Ocean from equatorial to polar latitudes. This in turn is likely to have been due to an increasing differential between insolation received at these latitudes, ultimately forced by the precessional cycle. The 'Mid-Holocene Transition' to wet conditions appears to contradict previous work from New Zealand that infers a drier late Holocene. This apparent contradiction can, however, be reconciled by increasing seasonality that would also explain the rise in charcoal abundance following the Mid-Holocene Transition. Colder, wetter winters resulted from decreasing winter (June) insolation and stronger rain-bearing westerlies, causing a decrease in peat humification. Warmer, drier summers resulted from an increase in summer (December) insolation and caused increased regional burning.

He:2020weihe,"The tectonic activity and potential for linkage of adjacent active faults are crucial for seismic assessment. As the two largest faults that bound the Weihe Graben (central China), the Qinling Northern Piedmont Fault (QNF, ~200 km) and the Huashan Piedmont Fault (HPF, ~150 km) are mainly responsible for seismic risk in this densely-populated area, where the 1556 M 8.5 Huaxian earthquake occurred with 830,000 fatalities. However, their tectonic activity and the degree of interaction remain poorly constrained, hampering an adequate seismic risk assessment of the Weihe Graben. Here, we integrate 23 new 10Be-derived catchment-averaged denudation rates of ~0.06–0.32 mm/yr with topographic metrics to evaluate the seismic risk. The results demonstrate that the landscape of the Qinling and Huashan Mountains is in transient state in response to the tectonic perturbations of the QNF and the HPF, with tectonic knickpoints formed along main streams and tributaries, and widespread un- stable drainage divides. These two faults have comparable tectonic activity, and are potentially capable of gener- ating earthquakes with the maximum magnitude of Mw ~7.7–7.9. Moreover, they have likely started linking, posing a greater seismic risk than previously estimated.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This has sometimes been the case because only shell was present, as for example in a midden dump where charcoal was originally absent or where the charcoal had been washed or leached away subsequent to deposition. However even when charcoal is present in a deposit, shell may be preferred because of the structure of the midden, where the shell lenses are packed with greater stability and demonstrable stratigraphic integrity than the surrounding deposits; or where it is believed that charcoal specks may have moved through the midden matrix subsequent to initial deposition.  ...

Casuarina woodland dominated the dryland vegetation over at least the past 6000 years, with a Melaleuca lanceolata-composite scrub association on the dunes. There is no evidence of higher sea levels in the area in the past 6000 years, with the present freshwater backdune swamp and lake systems being maintained or expanded. After a period of regional dune building between about 6000 and 4000 years BP, dune mobilization and advance in the last 4000 years or so overrode seaward brackish and fresh swamp systems. This dune advance severed Long Swamp from the Glenelg River estuary and precipitated the development of freshwater swamp conditions there. Burning of the swamp surface, often associated with the presence of Typha, is evident in a number of peat samples and is probably primarily anthropogenic. Continuous low-level burning occurred throughout the dryland vegetation of the region but is not associated with any long-term or widespread vegetation change.

Head:1989radiocarbon,"The radiocarbon dating of temperate zone and cold climate peats has yielded quite workable chronological sequences, providing the surface plant growth has not consisted of species having long penetrating roots. Godwin and Willis (1959) dated peat/wood sample pairs, and indicated that contamination in certain peat bogs could be negligible. Polach and Singh (1980) have shown that problems can occur in obtaining an accurate chronological sequence from an acid peaty swamp when roots from surface plants penetrate the lower peat layers. In ths case it is highly probable that dissolved organic material has mixed with stratigraphicaly lower peat so that the contamination of the relevant peat samples by both older and younger material has occurred. Contamination of older material also occurs when peat samplers drag down younger root and stem materia. Results obtained by Colhoun et al. (1982) strongly indicate that in a swamp area within a karst environment fed by alkaline ground water, secular equilibrium may occur once degradation of plant material reaches a certain stage. In this case, the swamp concerned is Pulbeena Swmp, Tasmania, and an equilibrium situation with ages around 45,000 years BP have been determined covering a depth from 165cm to 425cm. Contamination of samples can occur by both physical and chemical means. Hence pretreatment techniques for the radiocarbon dating of these samples need to take this into account (Gupta and Polach, 1985). These pretreatment techniques can inolve wet sieving to remove any coarse fibrous component which may not be contemporaneous with the sample matrix, and treatment of the samlpe material with hot dilute sodium hydroxide solution to isolate any mobile humic components within the sample. A comparison of 14C ages from both physical and chemical fractions of the peat samples may indicate the possible type and nature of sample contamination, since it is highly likely that the contaminating material would be either concentrated or isolated in one of the sample fractions (Gupta and Polach, 1985).",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

Heaton:2020marine,"The concentration of radiocarbon (14C) differs between ocean and atmosphere. Radiocarbon determinations from samples which obtained their 14C in the marine environment therefore need a marine-specific calibration curve and cannot be calibrated directly against the atmospheric-based IntCal20 curve. This paper presents Marine20, an update to the internationally agreed marine radiocarbon age calibration curve that provides a non-polar global-average marine record of radiocarbon from 0--55 cal kBP and serves as a baseline for regional oceanic variation. Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 14C curve and reconstructed changes in CO2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric 14C level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric 14C and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve. This robust propagation of uncertainty is fundamental to providing reliable precision for the radiocarbon age calibration of marine based samples. We make a first step towards deconvolving the contributions of different processes to the total uncertainty; discuss the main differences of Marine20 from the previous age calibration curve Marine13; and identify the limitations of our approach together with key areas for further work. The updated values for ΔR, the regional marine radiocarbon reservoir age corrections required to calibrate against Marine20, can be found at the data base http://calib.org/marine/.",2023-06-12 11:56:15.528 +0200,2023-06-12 11:56:15.528 +0200

Heimsath:1997soil,"Hilly and mountainous landscapes are partially to completely covered with soil under a wide range of erosion and uplift rates, bedrock type and climate. For soil to persist it must be replenished at a rate equal to or greater than that of erosion. Although it has been assumed for over 100 years that bedrock disintegration into erodable soil declines with increasing soil mantle thickness no field data have shown this relationship. Here we apply two independent field methods for determining soil production rates to hillslopes in northern California. First, we show that hillslope curvature (a surrogate for soil production7) varies inversely with soil depth. Second, we calculate an exponential decline of soil production rates with increasing soil depth from measurements of the in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations in bedrock sampled under soils of different depths. Results from both methods agree well and yield the first empirical soil production function.

Here we report soil production rates for the first time at the base of a retreating escarpment, on the soil-mantled hilly slopes in the upper Bega Valley, southeastern Australia. Concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in bedrock from the base of the soil column show that soil production rates decline exponentially with increasing soil depth. These data define a soil production function with a maximum soil production rate of 53 m/m.y. under no soil mantle and a minimum of 7 m/m.y. under 100 cm of soil, thus constraining landscape evolution rates subsequent to escarpment retreat. The form of this function is supported by an inverse linear relationship between topographic curvature and soil depth that also suggests that simple creep does not adequately characterize the hillslope processes. Spatial variation of soil production shows a landscape out of dynamic equilibrium, possibly in response to the propagation of the escarpment through the field area within the past few million years. In addition, we present a method that tests the assumption of locally constant soil depth and lowering rates using concentrations of 10Be and 26Al on the surfaces of emergent tors.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Heimsath:2001australia,"Late Quaternary rates of apparent soil production, bedrock incision, and average erosion are determined for the southeastern highlands of Australia using in situ produced cosmogenic nuclide concentrations of 10Be and 26Al. Apparent soil production rates define a steep, inverse exponential function of soil depth with a maximum of 143 m Ma−1 under zero soil depth. There were no observed soil depths between about 25 cm and zero, however, such that the maximum observed rate is about 50 m Ma−1. The Bredbo River catchment average erosion rate is 15±1 m Ma−1, and is similar to the average hillslope erosion rate of 16±1 m Ma−1. Bedrock incision rates average 9 m Ma−1 and suggest that the higher rates of hillslope erosion may be in response to a pulse of incision, perhaps generated by knickpoint propagation. Bedrock erosion rates inferred from a tor profile average 3.8 m Ma−1, with higher rates on other, more weathered tor tops. An aboveground tor profile of nuclide concentrations is consistent with a simple model of rapid stripping of the surrounding saprolite, supporting the view that at least one episodic period of increased denudation has affected the landscape evolution of the highlands. We test this hypothesis by using a simple landscape evolution model to reasonably predict the spatial variation of soil depth as well as the emergence of tors.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Heimsath:2009arnhem,"We report erosion rates and processes, determined from in situ ‐produced beryllium‐10 (10Be) and aluminum‐26 (26Al), across a soil‐mantled landscape of Arnhem Land, northern Australia. Soil production rates peak under a soil thickness of about 35 cm and we observe no soil thicknesses between exposed bedrock and this thickness. These results thus quantify a well‐defined ‘humped’ soil‐production function, in contrast to functions reported for other landscapes. We compare this function to a previously reported exponential decline of soil production rates with increasing soil thickness across the passive margin exposed in the Bega Valley, south‐eastern Australia, and found remarkable similarities in rates. The critical difference in this work was that the Arnhem Land landscapes were either bedrock or mantled with soils greater than about 35 cm deep, with peak soil production rates of about 20 m/Ma under 35–40 cm of soil, thus supporting previous theory and modeling results for a humped soil production function. We also show how coupling point‐specific with catchment‐averaged erosion rate measurements lead to a better understanding of landscape denudation. Specifically, we report a nested sampling scheme where we quantify average erosion rates from the first‐order, upland catchments to the main, sixth‐order channel of Tin Camp Creek. The low (∼5 m/Ma) rates from the main channel sediments reflect contributions from the slowly eroding stony highlands, while the channels draining our study area reflect local soil production rates (∼10 m/Ma off the rocky ridge; ∼20 m/Ma from the soil mantled regions). Quantifying such rates and processes help determine spatial variations of soil thickness as well as helping to predict the sustainability of the Earth's soil resource under different erosional regimes.

Heimsath:2010bega,"We report erosion rates determined from in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be across a spectrum of Australian climatic zones, from the soil-mantled SE Australian escarpment through semi-arid bedrock ranges of southern and central Australia, to soil-mantled ridges at a monsoonal tropical site near the Arnhem escarpment. Climate has a major effect on the balance between erosion and transport and also on erosion rate: the highest rates, averaging 35 m Ma−1, were from soil-mantled, transport-limited spurs in the humid temperate region around the base of the SE escarpment; the lowest, averaging about 1.5 m Ma−1, were from the steep, weathering-limited, rocky slopes of Kings Canyon and Mt Sonder in semi-arid central Australia. Between these extremes, other factors come into play including rock-type, slope, and recruitment of vegetation. We measured intermediate average erosion rates from rocky slopes in the semi-arid Flinders and MacDonnell ranges, and from soil-mantled sites at both semi-arid Tyler Pass in central Australia and the tropical monsoonal site. At soil-mantled sites in both the SE and tropical north, soil production generally declines exponentially with increasing soil thickness, although at the tropical site this relationship does not persist under thin soil thicknesses and the relationship here is ‘humped’. Results from Tyler Pass show uniform soil thicknesses and soil production rates of about 6.5 m Ma−1, supporting a longstanding hypothesis that equilibrium, soil-mantled hillslopes erode in concert with stream incision and form convex-up spurs of constant curvature. Moreover, weathering-limited slopes and spurs also occur in the same region: the average erosion rate for rocky sandstone spurs at Glen Helen is 7 m Ma−1, similar to the Tyler Pass soil-mantled slopes, whereas the average rate for high, quartzite spurs at Mount Sonder is 1.8 m Ma−1. The extremely low rates measured across bedrock-dominated landscapes suggest that the ridge–valley topography observed today is likely to have been shaped as long ago as the Late Miocene.

Heimsath:2020equilibrium,"The textbook concept of an equilibrium landscape, which posits that soil production and erosion are balanced and equal channel incision, is rarely quantified for natural systems. In contrast to mountainous, rapidly eroding terrain, low relief and slow‐eroding landscapes are poorly studied despite being widespread and densely inhabited. We use three field sites along a climosequence in South Africa to quantify very slow (2‐5 m/My) soil production rates that do not vary across hillslopes or with climate. We show these rates to be indistinguishable from spatially invariant catchment‐average erosion rates while soil depth and chemical weathering increase strongly with rainfall across our sites. Our analyses imply landscape‐scale equilibrium although the dominant means of denudation varies from physical weathering in dry climates to chemical weathering in wet climates. In the two wetter sites, chemical weathering is so significant that clay translocates both vertically in soil columns and horizontally down hillslope catenas, resulting in particle size variation and the accumulation of buried stone lines at the clay‐rich depth. We infer hundred‐thousand‐year residence times of these stone lines and suggest that bioturbation by termites plays a key role in exhuming sediment into the mobile soil layer from significant depths below the clay layer. Our results suggest how tradeoffs in physical and chemical weathering, potentially modulated by biological processes, shape slowly eroding, equilibrium landscapes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Heineke:2017reservoir,"The functionality and retention capacity of water reservoirs is generally impaired by upstream erosion and reservoir sedimentation, making a reliable assessment of erosion indispensable to estimate reservoir lifetimes. Widely used river gauging methods may underestimate sediment yield, because they do not record rare, high-magnitude events and may underestimate bedload transport. Hence, reservoir lifetimes calculated from short-term erosion rates should be regarded as maximum values. We propose that erosion rates from cosmogenic 10Be, which commonly integrate over hundreds to thousands of years are useful to complement short-term sediment yield estimates and should be employed to estimate minimum reservoir lifetimes. Here, we present 10Be erosion rates for the drainage basins of six water reservoirs in Western Turkey, which are located in a tectonically active region with easily erodible bedrock. Our 10Be erosion rates for these catchments are high, ranging from ~170 to ~1040 t/km^2/yr. When linked to reservoir volumes, they yield minimum reservoir lifetimes between 25 ± 5 and 1650 ± 360 years until complete filling, with four reservoirs having minimum lifespans of <=110 years. In a neighboring region with more resistant bedrock and less tectonic activity, we obtain much lower catchment-wide 10Be erosion rates of ~33 to ~ 95 t/km**2/yr, illustrating that differences in lithology and tectonic boundary conditions can cause substantial variations in erosion even at a spatial scale of only ~50 km. In conclusion, we suggest that both short-term sediment yield estimates and 10Be erosion rates should be employed to predict the lifetimes of reservoirs.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Heineke:2019menderes,"In extensional provinces with low-angle normal faulting (such as the Aegean region), both tectonic processes and erosion induce landscape change, but their interaction during the evolution of topography and relief accompanying continental extension has rarely been addressed. Here we present local and catchment-wide 10Be erosion rates that document the spatial pattern of erosion in the central Menderes Massif, a metamorphic core complex consisting of two asymmetric mountain ranges (Bozdağ and Aydın) bound by detachment faults and active grabens. Catchment-wide erosion rates on the northern flank of the Bozdağ Range are rather low (40–110 mm/k.y.) but reach values of >300 mm/k.y. on the steep southern escarpment—a pattern that reflects both topography and bedrock lithology. In the Aydın Range, erosion rates are generally higher, with mean erosion rates of ∼190 and ∼260 mm/k.y. on the northern and southern flank, respectively, and more variable along strike. In both ranges, erosion rates of ridge crests derived from amalgamated clasts are 30–90 mm/k.y. The difference between local and catchment-wide erosion rates indicates that topographic relief increases in most parts of the massif in response to ongoing fault-related uplift and concomitant river incision. Our findings document that tectonic processes exert a significant control on landscape evolution during active continental extension and are reflected in both the topographic signature and the spatial pattern of erosion. In the Menderes Massif, rock susceptibility to weathering and erosion is a dominant factor that controls the erosional contribution to rock exhumation, which varies spatially between ∼10\% and ∼50\%.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

A new suite of detrital 10Be data from the Three Rivers Region, SE Tibet is used to examine the relative importance of rainfall and relief in predicting patterns of erosion rates across a region with a strong gradient in exhumation. The data reveal millennial erosion rates vary by two orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 8 mm/yr across a regional gradient in exhumation rates inferred from previous thermochronology and cosmogenic nuclide data to the west and east of the study region. The new millennial erosion rates mirror the pattern of decreasing exhumation rates from west to east across the region, with the highest rates in the lower Salween River drainage and the lowest rates in the Yangtze River drainage. Erosion rates in the Mekong and Salween River drainages are correlated with mean local relief whereas in the Yangtze River drainage they are correlated most strongly with mean annual rainfall. The tectonic setting of this region, with a strong west to east gradient in exhumation rates which we infer to mirror a gradient in rock uplift, seems to exert a stronger control on erosion rate patterns than rainfall or relief.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Henderson:2006sunnyside,"Susan Kent had been working on a project excavating an open-air archaeological site in the eastern Free State, South Africa, at the time of her death.

We decided to continue with the analysis of the samples after her death and to complete the analysis of the artifacts from the site. This multifaceted approach to understanding the context of the archaeological horizon was the background against which Susan intended to investigate the spatial distribution of the lithic material as a means of identifying activity areas at the site. This chapter reports some of the results of the continuing analysis. The archaeological horizon has been dated to around 30 ka by optically stimulated luminescence. This date supports the final Middle Stone Age or Transitional Middle Stone Age/Later Stone Age designation suggested by a preliminary analysis of part of the lithic sample. Paleoenvironmental information from the site indicates that conditions were favorable for human settlement in the eastern Free State area during this period.

A mean date of 77,000 years was obtained for the layers containing the engraved ochres by thermoluminescence dating of burnt lithics, and the stratigraphic integrity was confirmed by an optically stimulated luminescence age of 70,000 years on an overlying dune.

Henshilwood:2014klipdrift,"Surveys for archaeological sites in the De Hoop Nature Reserve, southern Cape, South Africa resulted in the discovery of a cave complex comprising two locations, Klipdrift Cave and Klipdrift Shelter. Excavations commenced in 2010 with Later Stone Age deposits initially being recovered at the former site and Middle Stone Age deposits at the latter. The lithic component at Klipdrift Shelter is consistent with the Howiesons Poort, a technological complex recorded at a number of archaeological sites in southern Africa. The age for these deposits at Klipdrift Shelter, obtained by single grain optically stimulated luminescence, spans the period 65.5 +/- 4.8 ka to 59.4 +/- 4.6 ka. Controlled and accurate excavations of the discrete layers have resulted in the recovery of a hominin molar, marine shells, terrestrial fauna, floral remains, organic materials, hearths, lithics, ochre, and ostrich eggshell. More than 95 pieces of the latter, distributed across the layers, are engraved with diverse, abstract patterns. The preliminary results from Klipdrift Shelter presented in this report provide new insights into the Howiesons Poort in this sub-region and contribute further to ongoing knowledge about the complex behaviours of early Homo sapiens in southern Africa.

Herczeg:1991deposits,"Changes in the hydrologic cycle throughout the late Quaternary in Australia are evident from raised lake shorelines in the interior salt-lake basins, evaporites recovered from cores within these lakes, and carbonate pedogenesis within aeolian dune sequences. Most of these features are fraught with poor absolute chronologic control especially beyond the range of radiocarbon dating (> 35,000 yr B.P.). Uranium-series methods can potentially extend the chronology to about 350,000 yr B.P. provided that the minerals remain closed to uranium and thorium exchange after deposition and that corrections to detrital contamination can be adequately made. Samples of carbonates, gypsum and halite were collected from a variety of sites within the semi-arid and arid regions of southeastern Australia in an attempt to assess the feasibility of the U-series dating technique. The U-series method shows some promise for placing constraints on the timing of palaeoclimatic changes in Australia. Contamination with non-radiogenic 230Th can be overcome in most instances using an isochron correction scheme for a sequential acid-leach procedure. Uranium-series methods can provide the most reliable dates from samples in the arid regions of the continent where post-depositional exchange with groundwater U can be assumed to be minimal. Where reliable 14C dates have already been obtained, the U-series dates are in general accord except at Lake Mungo, N.S.W., where U-series dates are considerably younger. Two major high lake-stands were identified at Lake Frome, South Australia at ∼21,500 and 140,000 yr B.P. Dune stabilisation (i.e. humid conditions) inferred from dates of pedogenic CaCO3 occurred within the Strzelecki dunefield of northern South Australia at around 22,000, 68,000 and 145,000 yr B.P. These dates fall between most TL dates for dune-building episodes within the Strzelecki desert and therefore are consistent with palaeoclimatic reconstructions for the arid core of Australia. U-series dates on upper salt horizons of Lake Eyre and Lake Frome suggest that at least two periods of hyper-aridity occurred within the Holocene (< 10,000 yr B.P.).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hesse:2003blue,"Sand dunes on the Newnes Plateau (1000m a.s.l.), west of Sydney, were active during the Last Glacial Maximum. The scattered sand dunes are forested under the modern humid, temperate climate regime. Dune types range from parabolic to transverse lee dunes and sand sheets or patches. All point to the presence of conditions marginal for aeolian activity, made possible through wind acceleration on windward slopes, ready sand supply from the weathered sandstone of the plateau and sparse vegetation cover. Modern climate envelopes of sand dune activity in Australia predict that unrealistically drier conditions are necessary to allow wind transport at this site. Only additional impediments to plant growth, such as lower temperature and lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, appear to allow the necessary conditions for dune formation. These observations and conclusions extend our understanding of the extremes of the LGM climate in humid eastern Australia, confirming that the widespread treeless vegetation was also sparse, even in areas that today have annual rainfall above 1000mm.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hesse:2018macquarie,"Palaeochannels of lowland rivers provide a means of investigating the sensitivity of river response to climate-driven hydrologic change. About 80 palaeochannels of the lower Macquarie River of southeastern Australia record the evolution of this distributive fluvial system. Six Macquarie palaeochannels were dated by single-grain optically stimulated luminescence. The largest of the palaeochannels (Quombothoo, median age 54 ka) was on average 284 m wide, 12 times wider than the modern river (24 m) and with 21 times greater meander wavelength. Palaeo-discharge then declined, resulting in a younger, narrower, group of palaeochannels, Bibbijibbery (125 m wide, 34 ka), Billybingbone (92 m, 20 ka), Milmiland (112 m, 22 ka), and Mundadoo (86 m, 5.6 ka). Yet these channels were still much larger than the modern river and were continuous downstream to the confluence with the Barwon-Darling River. At 5.5 ka, a further decrease in river discharge led to the formation of the narrow modern river, the ecologically important Macquarie Marshes, and Marra Creek palaeochannel (31 m, 2.1 ka) and diminished sediment delivery to the Barwon-Darling River as palaeo-discharge fell further. The hydrologic changes suggest precipitation was a driving forcing on catchment discharge in addition to a temperature-driven runoff response.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hesse:2018palaeohydrology,"This study derives a new function describing the relationship of channel bankfull discharge (Qbf) to channel width in modern rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of southeastern Australia and applies this to dated palaeochannels of seven rivers to quantify late Quaternary discharge history in this important basin. All rivers show high MIS3 and MIS2 Qbf, declining in the Holocene. The Qbf of modern MDB rivers is correlated with total catchment precipitation but comparison with palaeochannel Qbf estimates shows that while enhanced runoff efficiency is necessary to account for much larger late Pleistocene palaeochannels, either lower or higher precipitation rates could have prevailed. A strong association between relative palaeo- Qbf enhancement and temperature suggests a temperature-mediated mechanism controlling river discharge, such as the fraction of precipitation stored as snow and thawing in spring, the enhancement of orographic rainfall, or CO2 feedbacks with vegetation cover. Significantly enhanced MIS3 Qbf requires an additional mechanism, such as increased rainfall. These findings are consistent with others that increased moisture availability was associated with past colder climates, although this was not necessarily the result of enhanced precipitation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Two fundamental questions in this context are how the northeastward motion of India is partitioned between strike–slip and thrust faults and how mountain building is counteracted by erosion. Cosmogenic nuclides allow us to address these questions, because they provide age constraints on tectonically offset landforms and constraints on erosion rates. After considerable debate on whether or not major strike–slip faults move at high rates of up to 20–30 mm/yr and absorb most of the continental deformation, it now appears that the three largest faults (Altyn Tagh, Haiyuan, Kunlun) have millennial slip rates of no more than 8–13 mm/yr, consistent with rates of elastic strain accumulation determined by geodetic methods.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

These data provide spatially averaged sediment yields of 130 2100 t·km-2·yr-1. Local rates of soil loss from agricultural plots on hillslopes are as high as 7000 t·km-2·yr-1. By comparison, natural rates of sediment generation, as determined by measuring cosmogenic 10Be in quartz from sediments and soils, are only 13 30 t·km-2·yr-1. The natural rates presented here provide a benchmark against which recent erosion rates, determined by various sediment gauging techniques, can be referenced.

Hewitt:2010bend,"Bend Road is an open site covering c.12 hectares on a sand sheet formation in southeast Melbourne, now bisected by the new Mitcham-Frankston tollway. Results from earlier salvage archaeology suggesting this was a significant scientific site were subsequently questioned on geomorphological grounds that indicated post-depositional disturbance. In 2006 the authors carried out extensive and detailed excavations and analyses that indicated that while both large-scale aeolian deflation events and smaller-scale bioturbation could be demonstrated, paradoxically the archaeology retained a clear coherence. While the bulk of the archaeology relates to the backed artefact period - the site has now yielded hundreds of asymmetric points and geometric microlith forms from the late Holocene - an earlier sequence extends back to 30-35,000 BP, putting Bend Road amongst the oldest known sites in Victoria. This paper summarises the methodological procedures and results that reflect both the natural disturbances to the site and the data that demonstrate its archaeological integrity, and points to a growing imbalance between increasingly sophisticated dating techniques available to the archaeologist and the levels of scale and resolution that usually pertain in archaeological sites.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Hidy:2014texas,"The Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers of Texas drain a tectonically quiescent, non-glaciated, and low-relief landscape inland from the Gulf of Mexico, where long-term [10^3--10^5] changes in denudation rates are probably driven largely by climate change. Here, we use cosmogenic 10Be to obtain spatially averaged denudation rates for these river catchments, primarily from terrace deposits associated with glacial or interglacial intervals over the past half million years. The denudation rates are ∼30–35\% higher during interglacial periods than during glacial periods, and correlate broadly with temperature. The results are consistent with predictions from the BQART sediment flux model, and support the hypothesis that increased weathering rates associated with warmer climates will accelerate landscape erosion. Furthermore, by analyzing 26Al/10Be in these deposits, we can estimate the bed load sourced from up-catchment surfaces. The stored coastal plain fraction varies from ∼10\% to 30\%, and is greater during times of relatively lower sea level. The results indicate that although sediment flux is moderated by coastal-plain storage, increased up-catchment flux during warmer interglacial periods outpaces evacuation of stored sediment during glacial periods, resulting in a net increase in sediment flux to the ocean during warm intervals. If this temperature–sediment flux relationship is valid beyond the Plio-Pleistocene transition, then global sediment flux to the ocean from passive, non-glaciated, and low-relief landscapes would have been greater during the Pliocene than in the cooler Quaternary.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Concentrations of the long-lived nuclides 10Be and 26Al yield consistently low catchment-wide denudation rates of ~ 3–29 mm ky− 1 (integrating over 21–194 ky), which reflect the low geomorphic gradients and the discontinuity of fluvial transport along the eastern Altiplano margin. No significant correlation is recorded between denudation rates of individual catchments and morphological basin parameters (slope, area, elevation). This is attributed to the overall little variability in morphology. The agreement between the denudation rates and published modern sediment discharge data suggests steady landscape evolution of the eastern Altiplano from the latest Pleistocene until today. ...

Hiscock:1988phd,"Archaeological research at Lawn Hill Station, northwest Queensland, was undertaken to investigate prehistoric stone artefact manufacture and settlement patterns. Of particular interest were the ways in which technology and settlement responded to changes in environmental conditions. Settlement strategies are inferred from a study of sixty-two sites and many thousands of artefacts found outside sites. Most archaeological material culture is found in close proximity to permanent water and outcrops of flakeable stone. It is concluded that this pattern resulted partly from more intensive occupation of those parts of the landscape, and partly from a greater rate of artefact discard. Other environmental features had more subtle effects on activity location. One pattern which emerged from the study was that site size is inversely related to distance from stone quarries, suggesting that site size and numbers of occupants are poorly correlated. Distance from quarries is found to be a major determinant of assemblage composition. Many technological attributes indicate that as stone was carried away from the quarry it was increasingly rationed to maximize stone use before a return to the quarry was necessary. Rationing was achieved by an increase in use-life and the application of knapping procedures which prolonged reduction. Cores, flakes and retouched flakes were all subjected to this economizing behaviour. Increased rationing would have been accompanied by changes in the rate and context of artefact discard, a conclusion which fits well with inferences about the distribution of material culture throughout the landscape. Since much of the inter-assemblage variation at Lawn Hill can be explained by the economics of stone procurement and manufacture, it is concluded that technology was largely unresponsive to other aspects of subsistence or settlement. This conclusion implies that seasonal patterns of movement or foraging are unlikely to be reconstructed from the stone artefacts at Lawn Hill. ...

It is now clear that the creation of the Van Diemen Gulf by sea level rise initiated widespread and long-term alterations in the landscape, and that changing patterns of settlement, foraging and technology reveal human responses to those transformations in their environment. Combined with an outstanding palaeo-environmental record for the Alligator Rivers region, the growth of archaeological information about prehistoric economies in this region makes it feasible to examine aspects human ecology in the past.

Hocknull:2007vertebrates,"A new middle Pleistocene vertebrate fossil record from eastern Australia, dated by U disequilibrium series, records the first Quaternary record of an Australian tropical rainforest fauna. This exceptionally rich fauna underwent extinction after a long period of relative faunal stability, spanning several glacial cycles, and persisted probably until 280000~years ago. Some time between 280000 and 205000~years ago the rainforest fauna was replaced by a xeric-adapted fauna. Since that time, the xeric-adapted fauna was replaced by a mesic-adapted fauna which was established by the Holocene. This is the first vertebrate faunal evidence in Australia of the middle Pleistocene Mid-Brunhes Climatic Event (MBE), a major climatic reorganisation that led to increased aridity in northern Australia from around 300000~years ago. Several independent palaeoclimate proxies suggest that the climatic shift to aridity was due to increased climatic variability and weakened northern monsoons, which may be manifested in the extinction of the aseasonal rainforest fauna and its replacement by an arid-adapted fauna. We extend the temporal ranges of several taxa from the Pliocene into the middle Pleistocene.

Such changes are seen most markedly in a reduction in the number of clay and temper combinations over time, which indicates less movement across the landscape to collect clays and tempers for pottery production. This pattern was identified in the Arawe Islands and Mussau Islands, and more tentatively in the Anir Islands of southern New Ireland Province. This research reviews and re-interprets the previous studies of the Anir pottery assemblages through mineralogical and geochemical analyses to test whether the Arawes and Mussau model applies in this region.

Holdaway:2005absence,"Radiocarbon determinations obtained from heat retainer hearths in four sampling locations in western New South Wales, Australia are reported, with age estimates ranging from the mid Holocene until the last few centuries BP. Hearths are first considered in their geomorphic setting to determine the likely age of the surfaces into which they were dug and the reasons why they are still extant today. Second, the radiocarbon determinations are analysed not to date single events in the past, but to construct a regional chronology of Indigenous Australian occupation. In this chronology, periods when hearths were not constructed are as important as periods when radiocarbon determinations indicate sustained hearth formation. Third, comparisons are made among the four sampling locations to determine regional patterns. Results suggest both regional and local patterns of occupation and abandonment, or at least very much reduced hearth construction, over the last two millennia. The increasing frequency of radiocarbon determination results from hearths as one approaches the present is likely to be a result of the relative abundance of well preserved recent surfaces in the locations we have studied and the consequent lack of relatively ancient surfaces.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Holdaway:2008challenging,"An intensification theory was developed in Australian archaeology in the early 1980s from a desire to make the study of Australian hunter-gatherers closer to theoretical developments in hunter-gatherer studies elsewhere. An apparent increase in the quantity and range of archaeological deposits was interpreted as demonstrating a combination of population increase and increased social complexity beginning 2-3000 years BP. Data were amassed in support of the theory but, with only one or two exceptions, they were not directly tested. Here we report on a series of studies that permit us to formulate a test for one aspect of the intensification theory. Chronologies constructed using OSL determinations of sediments are combined with the results of age determinations obtained from hearth charcoal to develop an ‘envelope of time‘ for human occupation of the southeast margin of the Australian arid zone. The results indicate that the apparent increase in the quantity and range of archaeological materials in the late-Holocene record of western New South Wales reflects the age of the surface on which these materials rest. The apparent rapid increase in the archaeological record at the end of the Holocene reflects the culmination of erosion and deposition processes through time that have removed or covered archaeological records from earlier periods. A large number of radiocarbon determinations from hearths suggest that occupation was not continuous in the late Holocene, with occupation ceasing in this area during periods of climatic change. Analysis of surface stone artefact assemblages does not support the existence of semi-permanent camps or the congregation of large numbers of people.

This is an intensive study of a closely co-located group of mounds within a geographically restricted area in a wider region where many more shell mounds have been reported. Valves from the bivalve Tegillarca granosa (Linnaeus, 1758) were dated. The dates obtained are used to calculate rates of accumulation for the shell mound deposits. These demonstrate highly variable rates of accumulation both within and between mounds. We assess these results in relation to likely mechanisms of shell deposition and show that rates of deposition are affected by time-dependent processes both during the accumulation of shell deposits and during their subsequent deformation. This complicates the interpretation of the rates at which shell mound deposits appear to have accumulated. At Wathayn, there is little temporal or spatial consistency in the rates at which mounds accumulated. Comparisons between the Wathayn results and those obtained from shell deposits elsewhere, both in the wider Albatross Bay region and worldwide, suggest the need for caution when deriving behavioural inferences from shell mound deposition rates, and the need for more comprehensive sampling of individual mounds and groups of mounds.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Hollands:2006simpson,"In central Australia, the most easterly extent of the MacDonnell Ranges border the Simpson Desert dunefield where widely spaced strike ridges intercept and isolate pockets of broad-crested linear dunes that reflect regional changes in Late Quaternary climate, flow regime and channel avulsion. An energetic Todd River reworked the eastern part of Camel Flat basin from 75-65ka until the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when it shifted eastwards, but with some flows persisting through the basin until about 10ka. Resulting desert surfaces of different age facilitate temporal comparisons of linear dune formation. Fine-grained red dunes, 75-65ka in age occur on the western floor of the basin and are ramped against the foot-slopes of the range. After the LGM, and especially during the Holocene, the river's departure enabled small, pale-coloured, closely spaced, coarser-textured linear dunes to form on the abandoned floodplain in the eastern basin, their orientation 20° farther west than the larger and older red dunes. This realignment indicates that the Australian wind-whorl shifted southwards some 160km or 1.5° after the LGM. Linear dunes in the northwestern Simpson Desert were formed by wind rifting involving vertical accretion of sand from a proximal source, not by long-distance sand transport with linear extension.

Analysis of these remains shows that the late Pleistocene fauna of Kangaroo Island was more extensive than the depauperate island fauna of today. The disappearance of many species reflects a reduction in open vegetation probably due to a combination of climatic change, the separation of the island postglacially by rising sea level, and the disappearance of a human population within the last 5000 years.

These span the periods c. 28,000-14,700 B.P. and c. 8000 B.P. to the present. Pollen analysis of the Pleistocene sediments indicates that an initial open shrubland was followed by grassland which became increasingly open with abundant composites. Eucalypts occurred in the area but were probably very sparse. The Holocene section records a coastal shrubland like that at present in the area. Intervals of occupation appear to have had little effect on vegetation recorded at the cave, but fires occurred in the vegetation during unoccupied as well as occupied phases. Comparison of the Pleistocene spectra with those from sites in near-coastal Tasmania and south-eastern Australia suggest that an open grassland with scattered trees was extensive from the Adelaide region down to the Bassian Plain.

There is a marked difference in the rate of infilling of the lakes, depending on the degree to which nutrient accession from allochthonous sediments has occurred. Some lakes have infilled slowly with no allochthonous input; these variations in the rate of sedimen- tation reflect the controls of climatic change and human modification of the catchment. Others have infilled very rapidly, and in these the role of tephra fall is crucial. The boost to nutrient levels afforded by periodic tephra fall is reflected in the changes recorded in limnic sediment and terrestrial pollen derived from the surrounding vegetation, An episodic decline in Nothofagus and other pollen reflects the increase in floristic and structural complexity of the rainforest vegetation in the absence of disturbance.

Direct dating of the finds has not as yet been possible, but stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and palynologic evidence indicates that these species lived near a climatic treeline in subalpine grassland in the late Pleistocene. At higher altitudes a rockshelter provided the second known mid-Holocene record of Thylogale christenseni and Thylogale sp. cf. brunii, apparently extinct grassland wallabies. The two largest remaining subalpine mammal species are being locally exterminated by hunting, leaving only a large murid, Mallomys gunung, which weighs less than 2.0 kg. The area thus records the disappearance of a grassland-adapted fauna. The possum Pseudocheirops cupreus dominates in modem hunting returns, although this species is totally absent from the local fossil records. It may thus be in the process of invading a vacated and disturbed niche from the upper montane forest.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hope:1994irian,"This paper reports the pollen analysis of a 10 m core from a mire at 780 m altitude and 2°S latitude on ultrabasic soils on a northern coastal range of New Guinea. The area is almost undisturbed by humans and the record is believed to cover about 60,000 yr B.P. The results show that montane forest grew around the site continously through the Late Pleistocene with a distinct increases in higher-altitude taxa from 25,000 to 10,500 yr B.P., the time of glacial maxima elsewhere. The invasion of the site by lower-altitude forest, which commenced at 10,500 yr B.P., was reversed after a few hundred years, and was not finally completed until about 7000 yr B.P. The results show that vegetation in the region has been sensitive to climatic change, the Pleistocene ecology being consistent with a temperature change of about 3–4°C. Times of change agree with other tropical areas even though the site climate was probably affected by changing sea levels. However, the tropical forest demonstrates overall long-term stability in which changes in dominance may reflect minor shifts in disturbance and tree longevity. ...

Hope:2005aru,"The Aru archipelago has attracted scientific interest over the past two centuries because of its position as a 'lifeboat' of the former Torresian plain of the continent of Sahul. Yet despite a lengthy visit by Wallace (1857, 1869; see Chapter 1, this volume), and subsequent studies of birds and other biota (e.g. van Balgooy and Nooteboom 1995; Monk et al. 1997; Flannery 1995), and geomorphology (Verstappen 1959), virtually no comprehensive environmental studies have been published with the exception of Nooteboom (1996). Although remoteness has been blamed for this state of affairs, the islands have experienced more than two centuries of reasonable communications and significant business activity based on pearling, bird of paradise feathers, and most recently timber extraction and commercial fishing. The islands have failed to attract comprehensive scientific work despite being known to western science, perhaps because New Guinea became accessible. For example, the large British Ornithological Union expedition called in at Dobo in 1910 as the last western outpost before tackling the New Guinean coast (Wollaston 1912), but made no studies on Aru. This chapter reviews what is known of the Aru natural environments, and provides a background to the archaeology by deducing the past environments and palaeoclimates from regional studies such as marine palynology (van der Kaars et al. 1997), reconstruction of past shorelines from bathymetry and isostatic modelling (e.g. Voris 2000; Yokoyama et al. 2001a), and limited local data.

 has risen from the sea only in the last few million years and is an actively evolving landmass with tectonic activity and very high rates of erosion and accumulation, these landscapes are relatively young. However, some surfaces have existed for 100,000 years or longer. Such landscapes often preserve records of climate and environmental change in land forms and deposits such as glacial moraines, lake bog and cave sediments, alluvium and colluvial mantles, and marine deposits (Williams et al. 1998). Information about the changes experienced by biomes comes from the study of biological and geomorphological records supported by dating. Here we consider what is known of the changes over the past 60,000 years or so, based on studies of pollen and sediments in swamps and small lakes in a range of Papuan environments from the lower montane to high alpine zones. There are also marine records of land pollen from southeast of Papua in the Banda Sea.

Sphagnum stablizes both the soil surface and stream banks and acts as a filter, removing suspended sediment. Sphagnum bogs alter the hydrology of streams by impeding flow and retaniing water, thus preventing erosion downstream in what would otherwise be extreme runoff events, and by maintaining a more constant flow between events.

The purpose of these tools and the nature of occupation are unknown. The altitude is too high for most food crops today and may have stood close to the treeline during the last glaciation. Three pollen and charcoal diagrams from a large swamp in the Kosipe Valley provide a record of swamp and dryland changes for more than 50 000 years. There have been considerable fluctuations in vegetation on the slopes and on the swamp which reflect both environmental change and anthropogenic influences. A gymnosperm-rich forest at the base is replaced by mountain forest dominated by Nothofagus about 42 000 years ago. Fire first becomes apparent across the swamp around 40 000 years ago but is not common during the time when subalpine herbs reach their best representation. Tree fern-rich grasslands form a mosaic with montane forest in a near-treeline environment. The Pleistocene–Holocene boundary is marked by a decline in Nothofagus and increase in lower montane mixed forest taxa. Charcoal increases before this time and the swamp vegetation becomes more grass-rich. Charcoal is at its maximum through the last 3000 years possibly reflecting climate variability as well as sedentary occupation and agriculture on the swamp margin. Supplementary pollen diagrams from two higher altitude sites support the evidence from the Kosipe Swamp cores. Charcoal, local catchment erosion and increases in disturbance taxa become more widespread in the last 5000 years at these sites, suggesting that local settlement at Kosipe may have lagged behind general landscape use by populations from lower altitudes.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This dry climate was maintained during at least the early part of the regressive phase, but became more humid during the maximum of the glacial stage.

Horrocks:2000hauhungatahi,"Pollen diagrams from four sites along an altitudinal sequence on Mt Hauhungatahi support fossil wood data (Ogden et al., 1997) in suggesting a fluctuating Holocene tree-line not exceeding the altitude reached in the early Holocene. Tree-line forest at 1340--1390 m during the periods 10 100--7500 and 5400--3800 cal. BP was associated with patchy Subalpine scrub communities above and below this altitude. Rapid decline of this Halocarpus-Phyllocladus forest at c. 7500 cal. BP, and again c. 3800 cal. BP was probably due to volcan ism. During 7500--5400 and 3800--1718 cal. BP tree-line forest was replaced by Subalpine scrub. The failure of forest to replace scrub during these two periods implies a long-lasting influence of the event which destroyed the forest, a continuation of disturbance events, or changed environmental conditions. After the Taupo volcanic eruption (1718 cal. BP) expansion of Libocedrus indicates an upwards movement of forest species into Subalpine scrub, followed by a decline. Volcanism has probably affected the vegetation of Mt Hauhungatahi directly and indirectly (through effects on soil drainage) throughout the Holocene. Results are consistent with increased climatic variability since 7500 cal.

Horrocks:2002auckland,"A multi--proxy analysis of a sediment core from Waiatarua, Auckland Isthmus, adds to an environmental history from the local wetland spanning the Late Glacial to modern times. Several distal tephra were recorded in the core: 8.5 ka Rotoma (reworked), 6.1 ka Tuhua (primary and reworked), most likely the 1.8 ka Taupo (the latter is previously unreported for the Auckland Isthmus), and one unidentified, possibly 665 yr BP Kaharoa. Pollen and diatom analyses of the core show that during the period c. 6000--c. 4800 yr BP, the site was a lake fringed with Cyperaceae/Leptospermum swamp. The lake became progressively shallower after c. 4800 yr BP, probably due to hydroseral infilling. Surrounding the lake was forest dominated by Dacrydium, Prumnopitys, Metrosideros, and Nestegis.

Horrocks:2002harataonga,"A pollen, sediment, and tephra record from a drained swamp at Harataonga contains a history of the local coastal environment from the Mid Holocene. This commences c. 6000 cal yr BP in a freshwater environment with swamp forest composed mainly of Laurelia, Leptospermum, Ascarina, and Cyathea spp. Dodonaea and Cyperaceae grew on margins of this forest. Forest on the hills surrounding the wetland comprised mainly Metrosideros, with emergent Dacrydium and Libocedrus. Ascarina, Rhopalostylis, and Cyathea dealbata type were a significant part of the understorey of the hillside forest. Around the time of deposition of the 5550 cal yr BP Whakatane tephra, a freshwater lake developed at the site. Extensive Cyperaceae swamp developed on the fringes of the lake. Shortly after c. 2900 cal yr BP, Dacrycarpus briefly invaded swamp forest, possibly as a result of storm disturbance, and the site made the final transition to swamp. Myrsine and then Hebe shrubs invaded fringes of the swamp as the water table fell, possibly as a result of a change to drier conditions in the Late Holocene. Polynesian deforestation, as indicated by the presence of abundant charcoal and Pteridium spores, is recorded in this core as occurring shortly after deposition of the c.600 cal yr BP Kaharoa tephra.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Horrocks:2005pupuke,"Lake Pupuke provides a near--complete, high--resolution environmental record of the Holocene from northern New Zealand. Tephra beds constrain the timing of a range of proxy indicators of environmental change, and demonstrate errors in a radiocarbon chronology. Agathis australis forest progressively increases from c. 7000 yr BP and, in conjunction with indicators of reduced biomass productivity, support a model of long--term climate change to drier conditions over the Holocene. However, except for Agathis, conifer--hardwood forest dominated mainly by Dacrydium cupressinum shows little change throughout the pre--human Holocene, suggesting environmental stability. Dramatic vegetation change occurred only within the last millennium as a result of large--scale Polynesian deforestation by fire. This happened a short time before the local eruption of c. 638 cal. yr BP Rangitoto Tephra. The identification of two eruptions of tephra from Rangitoto volcano has implications for future hazard planning in the Auckland region, because the volcanoes were previously considered single event centres. Changes in atmospheric circulation since the Late Glacial, possibly causing lower frequency of distal ashfall in Auckland during the Holocene, complicates the use of long--term records in hazard frequency assessment.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Horrocks:2007northern,"A sedimentological and plant microfossil history of the Late Quaternary is preserved in two sediment cores from early Polynesian ditch systems on southern Aupouri Peninsula. The study places human activities into a geomorphological and ecological context and allows comparison of natural and anthropogenic effects on two different geological settings: a floodplain and a relatively closed peat swamp. The data fill part of the current gap in the environmental record from northern New Zealand, namely MIS 3 (57k--26k yr BP). There is evidence for an increase in fire frequency in the region after 40k 14C yr BP, suggesting a shift to drier (and cooler) conditions. Pollen records show that conifer-hardwood forest dominated by podocarps (especially Dacrydium) prevailed prior to Polynesian arrival and deforestation within the last millennium, with Fuscopsora insignificant throughout. Both cores show sections with gaps in deposition or preservation, possible flood-stripping of peat during the pre-Holocene and mechanical disturbance by early Polynesians. The identification of prehistoric starch grains and other microremains of introduced Colocasia esculenta (taro) in both cores supports indirect evidence that the ditch systems of far northern New Zealand were used for the extensive cultivation of this crop.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Horsfall:1987phd,"This thesis presents the results of an exploratory investigation into the prehistoric occupation of the tropical rainforests of northeast Queensland. The limited ethnographic data available for this region describes how the Aboriginal societies who lived in these rainforests exploited their environment. A major feature of this exploitation was the intensive use of several species of toxic plants (many of them restricted to this district) as food staples. These plants were rendered edible by a complex process of treatment which included leaching in running water. Similar processes have been used to treat toxic food plants in many regions of the world, and their use may have a considerable antiquity. Although preservation of archaeological remains is not optimal in these humid tropics, numerous sites have been recorded, and excavations were undertaken at several of these. The oldest cultural deposits found so far are at Jiyer Cave (from 5100 BP), and an open site (Mulgrave River 2) was first occupied at about 2700 BP. Both of these sites contained remains of toxic and non-toxic food plants. Similar food plant remains were also recovered from other sites investigated by the author. The link between these archaeological remains of toxic food plants and intensive Aboriginal exploitation of the rainforests is not clear. This is due partly to the poor preservation of organic material in the older deposits particularly, and partly to inter-site variations. At Jiyer Cave, plant remains clearly identified as belonging to toxic species are no more than about 1000 years old, while non-toxic and unidentified species are as much as 4000 years old. Stone artefacts possibly associated with the processing of toxic species occur throughout these deposits, though specialised processing tools appear to be less than 1000 years old. At Mulgrave River 2, toxic food plant species occur in deposits dated to about 2000 BP, although they are more prevalent in the most recent levels. However, stone artefacts which might be associated with complex treatment procedures are rare at this site. The deposition rates of quartz artefacts are taken as possible indicators of intensity of site use. At Jiyer Cave, an increase of occupation is thus postulated for about 650 to 850 BP, whereas at Mulgrave River 2 the deposition of quartz artefacts peaks between 1800 and 1000 BP. In other words, there is no direct correlation between increased use of the sites and the presence of toxic plant remains, nor is there any correspondence between depositional histories of the two sites. Areas which still need investigation or which have arisen as a result of this research are noted, and a number of suggestions for future research are made.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here, we use four strath and fill river terraces along the Kızılırmak River in Turkey to unravel the deformation along the convex arc formed by the central North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a continental transform fault. 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl cosmogenic exposure ages of T3 and T2 strath terraces constrain their formation at 83 ± 15 ka and 67 ± 7 ka, respectively. We evidence frost-cracking during humid cold periods that bought younger carbonate cobbles on both terraces. T1, a younger fill terrace was probably emplaced during the MIS3 (30–40 ka) aggradational period or during the last glacial–interglacial transition. T0, the most recent fill terrace, was incised shortly before the 1668 earthquake based on 14C dating. It records a cumulated 14 ± 2 m offset linked to the 1943 and 1668 earthquakes. T3 shows a maximum offset of ~ 845 m and constrains a 10 mm/year geological slip rate that is lower than Holocene slip rates. It suggests temporal change in slip rates along the NAF. T2 and T3 also evidenced an uplift of 1 mm/year induced by transpressive deformation accommodated close to the NAF.

Hughes:2010changes,"Analysis of the changes in rates of catchment sediment storage can provide material evidence of the impact of landscape disturbance on catchment sediment flux. A number of studies have suggested increased sediment yields from the rivers draining to the Great Barrier Reef since European settlement in the mid-nineteenth century. Many of these predictions, which indicate increases between four to ten times the pre-disturbance estimates, are based on large-scale catchment modelling that make some critical assumptions about pre-disturbance erosion rates and/or sediment delivery ratios. In addition, the majority have not been validated by empirical data. This study uses single-grain OSL dating and 137Cs depth profiles to determine pre- and post-floodplain accretion rates in Theresa Creek, a subcatchment of the dry-tropical Fitzroy River basin.

Hughes:2014central,"The central lowlands of the Hunter Valley are rich in Holocene-aged open stone artefact concentrations but, to date, very few verified traces of Pleistocene occupation have been found there. The central lowlands would have been a reasonably attractive place to live, so logic suggests that there should be Pleistocene sites. Given the geomorphic and soil formation processes that have operated over the potentially long period of Aboriginal occupation of the central lowlands, however, it is likely that most archaeological materials older than ca 10,000 years have been either completely removed or widely dispersed across the landscape and are no longer recognisable as discrete Pleistocene-aged assemblages. Sand bodies have the greatest potential to contain older sites, but in most, if not all, cases their stratigraphic integrity has been compromised, principally by bioturbation. Understanding the landscape history over the last 90,000 years is the key to understanding why finding Pleistocene sites in the Hunter Valley has proven to be so difficult. Geoarchaeological evidence which illustrates this difficulty is presented from sites in three deposits of probable Pleistocene to early Holocene age - two in sand bodies and one in colluvium. On one sand body (the Warkworth sand sheet) there is contestable evidence for traces of pre-LGM occupation beginning more than ~23,000, possibly 50,000, years ago, but on the other (the Cheshunt dune) there is no evidence of occupation beyond the mid-Holocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hughes:2014geoarchaeology,"An extensive scatter of stone artefacts recorded as Site WE-1 on the Woolshed Embankment at the northern end of Lake George in southern NSW has been examined in the light of recent information on the lake's history. Optical dates show that the core of the embankment formed between ~22,000 and 15,000 ya. Archaeological materials have survived in the overlying deposits, though they have been affected to a degree by repeated cultivation. These archaeological assemblages are now able to be interpreted in the light of a reconstruction (by Fitzsimmons and Barrows [2010]) of the Holocene lake history.

Hughes:2014roxby,"Geomorphic investigations and optical dating integrated in a largescale archaeological excavation program at Olympic Dam have provided a chronology for dune formation extending back to before the last interglacial. Indurated dune cores of different ages have been in existence for at least 140 ka. The present dunes began building at >55 ka and they had largely formed by 21 ka at the height of the LGM. Dune building declined 21-14 ka, then increased again, peaking at 13 ka. Stable dune surfaces formed 12-9 ka and there was little sand accumulation during the Holocene. Parts of the dunes are mantled with loose, laminated sand mobilised after European grazing commenced in the mid-1800s. Most of the archaeological material is exposed at the surface and is of late Holocene age. The dunes also contain layers of stone artefacts (post LGM through to the late Holocene in age) which mark contemporary stable to slightly eroded surfaces. The post LGM archaeological assemblages can be correlated with palaeoclimatic records from other sources and they reflect episodic occupation of this arid landscape during relatively wet periods when the dunes were stable.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Hughes:2015preservation,"Alluvial terraces provide a record of aggradation and incision and are studied to understand river response to changes in climate, tectonic activity, sea level, and factors internal to the river system. Terraces form in all climatic regions and in a range of geomorphic settings; however, relatively few studies have been undertaken in tectonically stable settings in the tropics. The preservation of alluvial terraces in a valley is driven by lateral channel adjustments, vertical incision, aggradation, and channel stability, processes that can be further understood through examining catchment force-resistance frameworks. This study maps and classifies terraces using soil type, surface elevation, sedimentology, and optically stimulated luminescence dating across five tropical catchments in northeast Queensland, Australia. This allowed for the identification of two terraces across the study catchments (T1, T2). The T1 terrace was abandoned ~13.9ka with its subsequent removal occurring until ~7.4ka. Abandonment of the T2 terrace occurred ~4.9ka with removal occurring until ~1.2ka. Differences in the spatial preservation of these terraces were described using an index of terrace preservation (TPI). Assessments of terrace remnant configuration highlighted three main types of terraces: paired, unpaired, and disconnected, indicating the importance of different processes driving preservation. Regional-scale variability in TPI was not strongly correlated with catchment-scale surrogate variables for drivers of terrace erosion and resistance. However, catchment-specific relationships between TPI and erosion-resistance variables were evident and are used here to explain the dominant processes driving preservation in these tropical settings. This study provides an important insight into terrace preservation in the tectonically stable, humid tropics and provides a framework for future research linking the timing of fluvial response to palaeoclimate change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here, we quantify the complex interplay between tectonic uplift, topographic development, and erosion recorded in the hanging walls of several active reverse faults in the Ventura basin, southern California, USA. We use cosmogenic 26Al/10Be isochron burial dating and 10Be surface exposure dating to construct a basin-wide geochronology, which includes burial dating of the Saugus Formation: an important, but poorly dated, regional Quaternary strain marker. Our ages for the top of the exposed Saugus Formation range from 0.36 +0.18/−0.22 Ma to 1.06 +0.23/−0.26 Ma, and our burial ages near the base of shallow marine deposits, which underlie the Saugus Formation, increase eastward from 0.60 +0.05/−0.06 Ma to 3.30 +0.30/−0.41 Ma. Our geochronology is used to calculate rapid long-term reverse fault slip rates of 8.6−12.6 mm yr−1 since ca. 1.0 Ma for the San Cayetano fault and 1.3−3.0 mm yr−1 since ca. 1.0 Ma for the Oak Ridge fault, which are both broadly consistent with contemporary reverse slip rates derived from mechanical models driven by global positioning system (GPS) data. ...

We have now obtained a series of promising results from the same sequence with a test of optical dating on inclusions within the quartz grains. The innovative aspect of the measurements is the use of infrared irradiation to stimulate emission from the inclusions rather than conventional stimulation of the quartz itself by light of shorter wavelength.

Huntley:1996traps,"We describe a number of optical properties of a natural quartz that are related to the presence of electron traps having an optical depth of about 3 eV below the conduction band. Such traps are populated as a consequence of a radiation dose, and can be depopulated by optical excitation. An understanding of these processes is necessary in order to make use of these phenomena to determine the ages of sediments by optical dating. The recombination emission spectrum is found to consist mainly of a 0.65 eV wide band at 3.35 eV (370 nm). This and other information are used to deduce that the traps are electron traps. The excitation efficiency is found to increase with photon energy, and with temperature. The data are roughly in accordance with Urbach's rule, and an optical trap depth of about 2.9 eV is deduced. Above 100 °C thermal quenching causes a reduction in the observed luminescence. Isothermal decay studies show that there are actually several traps, possibly including a distribution of traps, with most of the luminescence arising from traps with thermal depths of about 1.6 eV and lifetimes deduced from extrapolation to be >2 x 106 years at 20 °C. The ratio of optical to thermal trap depths is in accordance with the Mott and Gurney prediction. A laboratory dose, besides filling traps, also has an effect that we attribute to population of competing recombination centres; this can be reversed with appropriate heating. Our understanding of the dose response and kinetics was tested on two samples of known age, and correct ages of ~ 120 000 years were obtained.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Hurst:2012curvature,"Erosion rates dictate the morphology of landscapes, and therefore quantifying them is a critical part of many geomorphic studies. Methods to directly measure erosion rates are expensive and time consuming, whereas topographic analysis facilitates prediction of erosion rates rapidly and over large spatial extents. If hillslope sediment flux is nonlinearly dependent on slope then the curvature of hilltops will be linearly proportional to erosion rates. In this contribution we develop new techniques to extract hilltop networks and sample their adjacent hillslopes in order to test the utility of hilltop curvature for estimating erosion rates using high‐resolution (1 m) digital elevation data. Published and new cosmogenic radionuclide analyses in the Feather River basin, California, suggest that erosion rates vary by over an order of magnitude (10 to 250 mm kyr−1). Hilltop curvature increases with erosion rates, allowing calibration of the hillslope sediment transport coefficient, which controls the relationship between gradient and sediment flux. ...

Hutchinson:2009tsunamis,"Bryant and others have interpreted geomorphological and archaeological evidence from south-central New South Wales (NSW) to infer repeated inundation of this coast by mega-tsunamis in late Holocene time.

BP, the time of the two most recent inferred mega-tsunamis. In addition, the mean probability distribution of the youngest calibrated radiocarbon ages from 52 archaeological sites on the south-central NSW coast (grouped in three tsunami-susceptibility classes on the basis of site elevation and distance from the shore) does not differ from random expectations, and shows no evidence that sites were permanently abandoned in the aftermath of these inferred events. The mean probability distributions of calibrated radiocarbon ages from 108 charcoal samples from these sites does not differ from random expectations, and offers little support for the inference that the sites were temporarily abandoned about 500 or 1500 cal. BP. Probability distributions based on 70 marine shell ages show strong century-scale cyclicity, but this is likely too regular to be a product of mega-tsunamis. Moreover, changes in shellfish exploitation patterns and adoption of new fishing technologies by Aboriginal people on this coast do not coincide with the times of inferred tsunamis. The archaeological evidence offers no support for the hypothesis that mega-tsunamis inundated this coastline in the late Holocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Huxtable:1977mungo,"ARCHAEOMAGNETIC studies made by Barbetti and McElhinny on prehistoric aboriginal fireplaces at Lake Mungo, Australia, indicate the occurrence of a polarity excursion about 30,000 years ago during which the geomagnetic field intensity increased to three times its presentday value; this main excursion was followed by a second one during which the intensity decreased to about one third of the present day value. This note reports thermoluminescent (TL) dating measurements that were carried out on fireplace material at the request of Dr M. F. Barbetti. Comparison of the TL dating with the radiocarbon ages is of particular interest because geomagnetic intensity variations may be the dominant cause of long term distortion of the radiocarbon time scale. The geomagnetic field gives the Earth partial shielding from cosmic rays, particularly from the lower energy, component that reaches only the upper atmosphere and is responsible for most of the radiocarbon production. If the geomagnetic intensity was lower than usual, then the production rate would have been higher and this would cause relevant radiocarbon dates to be too recent. In this comparison of TL and radiocarbon ages we have not, however, found evidence for a disturbance of the radiocarbon time scale caused by geomagnetic polarity excursions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Insel:2010bolivian,"We quantify spatial and temporal variations in denudation rates across the central Andean fold-thrust belt in Bolivia with particular focus on the Holocene. Measured and predicted 10Be cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) concentrations in river sediments are used to (1) calculate catchment-averaged denudation rates from 17 basins across two transects at different latitudes, and (2) evaluate the sensitivity of Holocene climate change on the denudation history recorded by the CRN data. Estimated denudation rates vary by two orders of magnitude from 0.04 to 1.93mmyr-1 with mean values of 0.40±0.29mmyr-1 in northern Bolivia and 0.51±0.50mmyr-1 in the south. Results demonstrate no statistically significant correlation between denudation rates and morphological parameters such as relief, slope or drainage basin size. In addition, the CRN-derived denudation rates do not reflect present-day latitudinal variations in precipitation. Comparison to -130 previously published denudation rates calculated over long (thermochronology-derived; >106yrs), medium (CRN-derived; 102-104yrs), and short timescales (sediment flux-derived; 101yrs) indicate temporal variations in denudation rates that increase between 0 and 200\% over the last -5ka. CRN modeling results suggest that the CRN-derived denudation rates may not be fully adjusted to wetter climate conditions recorded in the central Andes since the mid-Holocene. We conclude that large spatial variability in CRN denudation may be due to local variations in tectonics (e.g. faulting), while large temporal variability in denudation may be due to temporal variations in climate.

It establishes an ethnographic baseline for the European contact period, and summarises fieldwork in the southern Massim. It provides a first description of the prehistoric pottery sequence and draws together previous information from the northern Massim and the Mailu area into a study of the archaeological origins of the Kula Ring. In the last centuries of prehistory the Massim became isolated from the PNG mainland by warfare and, at the same time, islands of the Massim became more connected. The geographical configuration of the Kula was influenced by seasonal winds and the sailing performance of nagega canoes. Some islands were advantaged in their location, but others lay upwind from the Kula islands and outside the Ring. Among the Kula islands, exchanges resolved into a gyre and concepts of Kula magic and ritual spread across the open borders of adjacent communities. In late prehistory the small southern island of Tubetube became a dominant centre when it established a direct connection with the trade in industrial stone from Woodlark Island. Finally, when the Massim was pacified by the colonial government the ethnographic Kula was free to sail, and sea lanes to the mainland opened again.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Modern pollen-vegetation relationships in the two Proteaceae species rich nodes of the northern and southern sandplains were quantified.

The vegetation and environmental setting during three pivotal periods of the Cainozoic: Holocene, Pliocene and Eocene, were investigated. Eocene sediment from Lake Lefroy confirmed the presence of a Nothofagus dominated rainforest in the Middle to Late Eocene.

To determine the dose received since deposition, measurements were made on 5 mg aliquots of purified quartz grains using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol. The results of several internal check procedures are reported and at least 15 replicate dose determinations are presented for each sample. Combining these dose values with measurements of the radioactive content of each sample resulted in an age of 69.2 +/-3.9 ka for the unit within the cave, and a mean age of 70.1 +/-1.9 ka for all three dune samples.

A series of checks was carried out on each grain to ensure that the luminescence signals were reproducible, and that they were derived from quartz. This led to acceptance of less than 5% of the grains. An estimate of the radiation dose for the sand unit was obtained by combining the values using the central age model. In order to use a larger number of grains that might be representative of the sand unit, the radiation dose was also estimated by using the signal from the above grains, combined with the signals from those grains that had lower signals, but nonetheless contributed to the total light sum; this utilised between 9 and 18% of the grains. This enables us to obtain estimates of the ages as 67.3+/-3.8 ka, 65.6+/-2.8 ka and 68.8+/-3.0 ka for the three samples.

The cave then appears to be unoccupied until oxygen isotope substage 5a on the basis of four OSL ages for archaeological phase M2, ranging from 84.6 +/- 5.8 to 76.8 +/- 3.1 ka; these levels contained large hearths and bone tools. An age of 72.7 +/- 3.1 ka was obtained for the final MSA archaeological phase, M1, from which deliberately engraved ochre and shell beads were recovered along with bifacial stone points. We conclude that the periods of occupation were determined by changes in sea level, with abundant sources of seafood available in times of high sea level and with the cave being closed by the accumulation of large dunes during periods of low sea level, such as during oxygen isotope stages 4 and 6.",2023-06-05 10:57:13.636 +0200,
Jacobs:2010pinnaclepoint,"Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements are reported for single aliquots and single grains of quartz from sedimentary deposits within Cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, South Africa (PP13B). Ages have been obtained for 30 samples from the Middle Stone Age and from sterile geological deposits at the base and top of the sediment sequence. The ages for all the archaeological units have been obtained from single-grain measurements that enable unrepresentative grains to be rejected after they have been scrutinized for their OSL behavior. The shape of the equivalent dose distribution and the degree of spread in equivalent dose for each sample have also been scrutinized for evidence of depositional and post-depositional effects that can influence the accuracy of the age estimates. This study also used the same systematic approach as that used for the dating of the Howieson's Poort and Still Bay in South Africa. This single-grain approach results in more accurate and precise age estimates that place all ages measured and analyzed in this way on a common timescale. Four periods of human occupation have been dated to ~162ka, ~125ka, ~110ka, and ~99-91ka during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, 5e, 5d, and 5c, respectively. Occupation of the site appears to have occurred at periods of higher sea level and increased aeolian activity, and the cave was ultimately sealed by the accumulation of a large dune ~90ka ago that infilled the cave, but also blanketed the cliff face above the cave, thus preventing further habitation of the site until ~39ka.",2023-06-05 10:57:13.636 +0200,
Jacobs:2013blombos,"This paper presents a series of new single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages for the Still Bay at Blombos Cave, South Africa, and compares them to previously published OSL, thermoluminescence (TL) and electron-spin resonance (ESR) ages for this site. Details are provided about the measurement and analytical procedures, including a discussion of the characteristics of the OSL signals of individual quartz grains. This forms the basis for further investigations into the sensitivity of the equivalent dose (De) estimates to a range of different analytical approaches, including changes in the size of the test dose, the choice of signal integration interval, the subtraction of an appropriate background, and isolation of the most light-sensitive ('fast') component of quartz OSL. We also report the results of an inter-operator test of De determination using seven new samples from Blombos Cave, and demonstrate the reproducibility of results obtained for two samples that had been dated previously at another laboratory and were measured and analysed again in this study. Together, these tests validate the robustness of the Blombos Cave single-grain OSL age estimates to a variety of alternative OSL dating procedures. We have incorporated, for the first time, these ages for Blombos Cave into a data set of all single-grain OSL ages for Still Bay and Howieson's Poort sites across southern Africa, and have used a statistical model to re-evaluate the timing and duration of the Still Bay industry. We calculate the most plausible start and end dates of the Still Bay as 72.2 ka and 71.3 ka, respectively -- amounting to a duration of 0.9 ka -- and estimate (with conventional 95% confidence) that this industry began no earlier than 75.5 ka, ended no later than 67.8 ka and lasted no longer than 6.6 ka.",2023-06-05 10:57:13.636 +0200,

Jankowski:2014micromorphology,"The ability to position landscapes in a context of time and space is a particular goal of Quaternary science research. The lack of context for dating samples published previously for MacCauley's Beach, an important site for the reconstruction of Australian sea levels, warranted a re-evaluation of both the site stratigraphy and chronology. In this study, we combined optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sedimentary quartz grains and soil micromorphology of the same samples to improve our understanding of the depositional history and chronology of the sediments. This combination allowed the contextualization of samples not only in time and space, but also in terms of their depositional histories. The latter is important in OSL dating, where pre-, syn- and post-depositional processes can all influence the accuracy and precision of the final age estimates. The sediment profile at MacCauley's Beach is made up of three major units. The basal mottled mud layer has undergone extensive pedogenesis since deposition, and only a minimum age of 14.7+/-2.7 ka could be calculated. The overlying grey mud, with OSL ages from the bottom and top of the unit of 10.0+/-0.7 and 7.7+/-0.5 ka, respectively, shows evidence of soil structure collapse. This unit correspond to the onset of the mid-Holocene sea-level high stand for this region. The overlying sand layer was first deposited at 7.5+/-0.4 ka, with deposition continuing beyond 6.6+/-0.4 ka. Not only does the chronology presented constrain the timing of deposition (and the extent of post-depositional processes) at MacCauley's Beach, but the methodological approach used here can be applied to any site to aid in the interpretation of formation processes and assess their influence on OSL age determination.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Jankowski:2016kudjal,"We describe the stratigraphy and chronology of Kudjal Yolgah Cave in south-western Australia, a late Quaternary deposit pre- and post-dating regional human arrival and preserving fossils of extinct and extant fauna. Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating shows that seven superposed units were deposited over the past 80 ka. Remains of 16 mammal species have been found at the site, all of them represented in Unit 7, for which seven OSL ages indicate accumulation between 80 and 41 ka. Single-grain OSL equivalent dose distribution patterns show no evidence of reworking of older or younger sediments into Unit 7, but late Holocene charcoal has been washed into the top of it from adjacent Unit 2, deposited 1.2 ka ago. Six species that failed to survive the Pleistocene are recorded in Unit 7, but only the south-western wombat Vombatus hacketti is recorded in younger units. Two species, the large extinct kangaroos Protemnodon sp. cf. P. roechus and Procoptodon browneorum, are represented by articulated specimens near the top of Unit 7, immediately adjacent to an OSL sediment sample dated to 41  2 ka. These are the youngest reliably dated records of these genera from mainland Australia, and among the youngest megafaunal remains from the continent. All species currently known from the middle Pleistocene of the south-west persisted into the late Pleistocene, which removes a key pillar supporting the argument against a driving role for human impacts in the extinctions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Jankowski:2020mungo,"The Willandra Lakes region sits on the southern margin of Australia’s arid core and is one of the oldest localities on the continent known to have been occupied by Australia’s First People. The archaeological traces that accumulated in the Lake Mungo lunette paint a picture of changing land use over the past ∼50 thousand years (ka) and some of these are likely to have been responses to changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions. This study set out to determine the finest temporal resolution that can be used to study the depositional and palaeoenvironmental history of the Lake Mungo lunette. The investigation focused on the depositional history documented within stratigraphy exposed in an eroding gully in the southern part of the lunette; Gully 10. A stratigraphic framework was developed using sedimentological and soil micromorphological analysis. This framework was then fixed in time by 56 single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age estimates. These data sets were then combined into a Bayesian model that indicated three depositional phases: >100 ka (LU1), ∼65–33 ka (LU2–LU3), and from ∼30 to 16 ka (LU4–LU9), with the late Pleistocene and Holocene samples (LU10–11) not being modelled. Furthermore, the redating of thirteen Lower and Upper Mungo OSL samples from Bowler et al. (2003)’s study of the southern tip of the lunette yielded younger age estimates for twelve of these, bringing them into line with previously published independent age control as well as the ages presented in this study.

Jansen:2013lowland,"Intraplate tectonism has produced large-scale folding that steers regional drainage systems, such as the 1600km-long Cooper Ck, en route to Australia's continental depocentre at Lake Eyre. We apply cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating in bedrock, and luminescence dating in sediment, to quantify the erosional and depositional response of Cooper Ck where it incises the rising Innamincka Dome. The detachment of bedrock joint-blocks during extreme floods governs the minimum rate of incision (17.46.5mm/ky) estimated using a numerical model of episodic erosion calibrated with our 10Be measurements. The last big-flood phase occurred no earlier than ∼112–121ka. Upstream of the Innamincka Dome long-term rates of alluvial deposition, partly reflecting synclinal-basin subsidence, are estimated from 47 luminescence dates in sediments accumulated since ∼270ka. Sequestration of sediment in subsiding basins such as these may account for the lack of Quaternary accumulation in Lake Eyre, and moreover suggests that notions of a single primary depocentre at base-level may poorly represent lowland, arid-zone rivers. Over the period ∼75–55ka Cooper Ck changed from a bedload-dominant, laterally-active meandering river to a muddy anabranching channel network up to 60km wide. We propose that this shift in river pattern was a product of base-level rise linked with the slowly deforming syncline–anticline structure, coupled with a climate-forced reduction in discharge. The uniform valley slope along this subsiding alluvial and rising bedrock system represents an adjustment between the relative rates of deformation and the ability of greatly enhanced flows at times during the Quaternary to incise the rising anticline. Hence, tectonic and climate controls are balanced in the long term.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Jenkins:1997mornington,"Palynological analysis of swamp sediments from an interdunal swale provides a vegetation and environmental history from c. 4500 years BP to present. Although essentially the same vegetation communities of the site and surrounding area are recorded through the period, their distributions have changed due to regional climatic variation and human influence, particularly the impact of European land settlement. Changes in aquatic plant assemblage are related to localised fluctuations in the hydrological regime. Melaleuca and Cypcraceae have persisted as dominant taxa, with the hydrophytc Villarsia increasing in importance with a change from ephemeral swamp conditions to semi-permanent water about 1500 years ago. Disturbance to the hydrological regime in the European settlement phase has seen the proliferation of the aquatic herb Myriophyllum and increases in Restionaceae and Melaleuca as previously swamp margin communities expanded over the wetland. A Eucalyptus woodland with an open heath understorey characterised the dryland vegetation. Allocasuarina was a significant component of the regional vegeration. Increased plant diversity of the woodland understorey and an expansion of wetter forest elements were recorded after 3200 BP, probably due to an increase in climatic variability and associated higher burning levels, both natural and anthropogenic, and generally higher rainfall, respectively. Marked changes in the dryland record, which include a sharp decline in Allocasuarina percentages, the introduction of Pinus and exotic herbs, as well as an increase in the density of the shrub layer, are associated with European settlement and possibly alteration to fire regimes.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

At each site, fungi (sporocarps of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal species) were the major food, and most of the remainder of the diet consisted of grass leaf and stem, roots and tubers, and lilies. Forbs and invertebrates were also eaten, but in small quantities. Fungus consumption was greatest at the wettest forest type and least at the driest site. Seasonal variation was insignificant except at the driest site, where fungus consumption peaked in the late wet season and dropped during the dry season; this seasonal fall in fungus consumption was associated with an increase in consumption of grass and roots and tubers. There was little seasonal variation in body condition, except at the driest site, where the dry-season decline in the proportional representation of fungus in the diet was associated with a decline in body condition. Breeding was continuous and aseasonal. B. tropica is found only in a narrow zone of sclerophyll forest along the western edge of wet tropical rainforest in north-eastern Queensland.

Jonell:2016vietnam,"The Song Gianh is a small‐sized (~3500 km2), monsoon‐dominated river in northern central Vietnam that can be used to understand how topography and climate control continental erosion. We present major element concentrations, together with Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, of siliciclastic bulk sediments to define sediment provenance and chemical weathering intensity. These data indicate preferential sediment generation in the steep, wetter upper reaches of the Song Gianh. In contrast, detrital zircon U‐Pb ages argue for significant flux from the drier, northern Rao Tro tributary. We propose that this mismatch represents disequilibrium in basin erosion patterns driven by changing monsoon strength and the onset of agriculture across the region. Detrital apatite fission track and 10Be data from modern sediment support slowing of regional bedrock exhumation rates through the Cenozoic. If the Song Gianh is representative of coastal Vietnam then the coastal mountains may have produced around 132 000–158 000 km3 of the sediment now preserved in the Song Hong‐Yinggehai Basin (17–21\% of the total), the primary depocenter of the Red River. This flux does not negate the need for drainage capture in the Red River to explain the large Cenozoic sediment volumes in that basin but does partly account for the discrepancy between preserved and eroded sediment volumes. OSL ages from terraces cluster in the Early Holocene (7.4–8.5 ka), Pre‐Industrial (550–320 year BP ) and in the recent past (ca . 150 year BP ). The older terraces reflect high sediment production driven by a strong monsoon, whereas the younger are the product of anthropogenic impact on the landscape caused by farming. Modern river sediment is consistently more weathered than terrace sediment consistent with reworking of old weathered soils by agricultural disruption.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Jones:1990illawarra,"Palynological evidence is presented which supports the view that Illawarra was not entirely covered by dense rainforest at the time of European settlement. In the environs of Jamberoo and Kiama, there may have been wet sclerophyll forest and subtropical rainforest in existence during the last five millennia of the Holocene. The palynological data are unable to substantiate estimates of the amount of rainforest prior to its clearance by Europeans. However, in view of both the number of pollen and spore taxa from plants now characteristic of regional sub-tropical rainforest, and the almost certain under-representation of these taxa in the palynological record, it is feasible that such vegetation occupied a considerable part of this area, with wet sclerophyll present on less climatically and edaphically favoured sites. Local wetland vegetation dynamics seem to have involved saline being replaced by freshwater marsh c.2600 B.P.

Jones:2017stoney,"Tasmania's dry, inland east is ideally positioned to inform models of late Quaternary environmental change in southern Australasia. Despite this, it remains poorly represented in the palaeoecological record. Here, we seek to address this with a >13,000-year vegetation and fire history from Stoney Lagoon, a site at the eastern margin of Tasmania's inland Midlands plains. Pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that here, a relatively moist early deglacial was followed by a dry later deglacial (ca. 14,000--12,000 cal. BP), when sclerophyll forests became well established and burning increased. This suggests that the Midlands' vegetation responded to the climatic signals characterising Australia's south-eastern coast rather than those governing developments in western Tasmania. Dry sclerophyll forest persisted throughout the Holocene; with a pronounced transition from more to less grassy understoreys between ca. 9000 and 7000 cal. BP. From the mid-Holocene, the sclerophyll community remains relatively stable. However, increased fire activity and trends in moisture-sensitive taxa suggest generally drier conditions coupled with greater hydroclimatic variability under the strengthening influence of the El Niño--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Overall, these results highlight the role of macro-scale climatic shifts in shaping vegetation development in Tasmania's inland east, while hinting at the concurrent importance of local ecological drivers. This highlights the need for spatially diverse studies to understand interactions between drivers of long-term environmental change in sub-humid southern Australia. This research also supports conservation by strengthening understandings of pre-colonial baselines in this highly modified landscape.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Jones:2022calperum,"This paper presents the results of an archaeological investigation into anthropogenic earth (oven) mounds located on the Murray River floodplain at Calperum Station in the Renmark region of South Australia. Six mounds were excavated and their contents examined. Sediment analyses were also conducted to assess magnetic susceptibility, grain size and loss on ignition. Radiocarbon age estimates were obtained on shell and charcoal. Mound contents primarily included anthropogenically burnt clay (heat retainers), charcoal, fragments of mussel shell as well as very minor quantities of other faunal material and stone artefacts (which were consistent with previous lithic assessments for the region). The radiocarbon age determinations from 15 samples indicate that mounds were formed by Aboriginal people on the Calperum floodplain from at least 3981–3723cal BP and utilised up to the time of European invasion. The very minimal amount of faunal remains (other than mussel shell), artefacts and a general lack of other material evidence apart from clay heat retainers, confirms that these features were single purpose and not used as living areas. Sediment analyses and radiocarbon dates indicate a high degree of homogeneity within mounds but provide insights into an economic transition on the Calperum floodplain, at around 4000cal BP involving a food-production procurement strategy based on heat retainer technology and the exploitation of emergent macrophytes.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

All radiocarbon dates are calibrated here for standardization, many of them for the first time in publication. Our results indicate a clear disparity in the distribution of dated archaeological sites across Indonesia, which seem to be mostly influenced by ease of access, international collaboration focus, and the history of prior research success in a region. In addition, our review of the literature revealed a clear lack of standardization in the presentation of radiocarbon dates and their usage in publications. Despite the impressive increase in dating across Indonesia, our review of the literature suggests numerous excavated prehistoric sites in Indonesia remain undated at this time.

Kai:2015qilian,"Knowledge of temporal and spatial distribution of erosion is the key to understanding the climate-tectonic interaction and topographical evolution of mountain belts and to making clear the long debate whether erosion is controlled by tectonics or climate. The newly developed cosmogenic nuclides method provides us with an advanced and convenient tool to measure millennium basin-wide erosion rate, allowing us to analyze its relationship with modern climatic, geomorphic and tectonic factors. Hence, we adopted the 10Be method to investigate the basin-wide millennium erosion rates of Northern Qilian Mountains and aimed to find the controlling factors of erosion rates of this area. We collected and analyzed 9 samples from Heihe River and the front of the Northern Qilian Mountains. Our results, together with published 10Be derived erosion rates in this area, showed that the erosion rates of the basins we studied ranged from 18.7 mm/ka to 833 mm/ka, and that the weighted average erosion rates of the middle section of the Northern Qilian Mountains was about 323 mm/ka. Spatial distribution of erosion rates and correlation analysis reveal that the basin-wide erosion rate was nonlinearly correlated to the basin average slope, while no apparent correlation between erosion rate and precipitation was found. Altogether, it indicated that the slope or terrain steepness was the major controlling factor on erosion rate of the Northern Qilian Mountains area. By comparing the basin-wide average erosion rates and the vertical slip rates of faults of the Northern Qilian Mountains, our research also revealed that the surface erosion rates generally agreed with vertical slip rates of the Northern Qilian Mountains faults, implying that the Northern Qilian Mountains area was experiencing topographical uplift and outgrowth.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Two OSL ages from channel sand and overlying source-bordering dune sand indicate that large sinuous channels, with bankfull discharges six to eight times greater than the present river, were fully established by 34 ka BP. This conclusion is consistent with regional lake level and geomorphic evidence of cool, pluvial conditions that preceded the last glacial maximum (LGM), providing new information on a long-standing palaeohydrological problem caused by the apparent synchroneity of large river systems and regional aridity.

Kemp:2010lachlan,"Inland rivers in southeastern Australia preserve a long record of surface palaeochannels, accompanied by alluvial terraces that reflect changes in water and sediment discharges from the southeastern highlands through much of the last glacial cycle. A compilation of ages on rivers of the southern Murray-Darling Basin together with new dates from the Lachlan River suggest that the fluvial response to climate change has been regionally consistent and responsive to climate change on timescales <10~ka. For much of the last glacial cycle, inland rivers were mixed-load, sinuous single and anabranching channels that carried bankfull discharges of between 3 and 11 times present day rivers. Incision of the upper alluvial plains and valleys occurred in the lead up to the coldest part of the last glacial cycle. This was followed at 34~ka by the synchronous development of large meandering channels that may have been associated with lower evapotranspiration from alpine highland catchments accompanied by higher precipitation. Smaller channels and declining lateral channel sedimentation suggests arid climates during the last glacial maximum and late glacial period with seasonally large, actively migrating channels being maintained in rivers dominated by snowmelt runoff from the Australian Alps. During the Holocene, sensitivity to recorded changes in precipitation amounts and variability differed between catchments with some rivers constructing larger or more actively migrating channels in the early to mid-Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Kemp:2014tablelands,"Regional changes in vegetation and environment in the last 16 ka have been reconstructed from Micalong Swamp and Willigobung Swamp (35°S) on the western Southern Tablelands of New South Wales (NSW). Micalong Swamp lies at 980 m above sea level (a.s.l.), which is close to the subalpine treeline at this latitude. Willigobung Swamp (780 m a.s.l.) approaches the modern ecotone between dry and wet montane forest formations. The sites are sensitive to shifts in temperature and precipitation and are the first reported pollen records from the western montane slopes of NSW. A radiocarbon-based chronology indicates that Micalong Swamp was a swampy, gravel floodplain surrounded by alpine grassland before 16.1 ka. Subalpine woodland may have become established at 1000 m by 16–14 ka. Organic fen sedimentation developed <11.8 ka at Willigobung, and ∼11.7 ka at the higher elevation Micalong Swamp. Wet forest elements were present at both sites around 10 ka and persisted for 3–4 ka. Sedimentation in a shallow lake or fen between 10 and 8 ka supports this evidence for wetter conditions in the early Holocene. In the late Holocene an expansion of subalpine flora between 2.7 and 0.9 ka preceded by shallow lake/fen sedimentation is consistent with regional evidence for neoglacial cooling.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Kemp:2017interactions,"Climatic forcing of fluvial systems has been a pre-occupation of geomorphological studies in Australia since the 1940s. In the Riverine Plain, southeastern Australia, the stable tectonic setting and absence of glaciation have combined to produce sediment loads that are amongst the lowest in the world. Surficial sediments and landforms exceed 140,000 yr in age, and geomorphological change recorded in the fluvial, fluvio-lacustrine and aeolian features have provided a well-studied record of Quaternary environmental change over the last glacial cycle. The region includes the Willandra Lakes, whose distinctive lunette lakes preserve a history of water-level variations and ecological change that is the cornerstone of Australian Quaternary chronostratigraphy. The lunette sediments also contain an ancient record of human occupation that includes the earliest human fossils yet found on the Australian continent. To date, the lake-level and palaeochannel records in the Lachlan-Willandra system have not been fully integrated, making it difficult to establish the regional significance of hydrological change. Here, we compare the Willandra Lakes environmental record with the morphology and location of fluvial systems in the lower Lachlan. An ancient channel belt of the Lachlan, Willandra Creek, acted as the main feeder channel to Willandra Lakes before channel avulsion caused the lakes to dry out in the late Pleistocene. Electromagnetic surveys, geomorphological and sedimentary evidence are used to reconstruct the evolution of the first new channel belt following the avulsion. Single grain optical dating of floodplain sediments indicates that sedimentation in the new Middle Billabong Palaeochannel had commenced before 18.4  1.1 ka. A second avulsion shifted its upper reaches to the location of the present Lachlan River by 16.2  0.9 ka. The timing of these events is consistent with palaeohydrological records reconstructed from Willandra Lakes and with the record of palaeochannels on the Lachlan River upstream. Willandra Lakes shows high inflows during the Last Glacial Maximum (∼22 ka), but their subsequent drying between 20.5 ka and 19 ka was caused by river avulsion rather than regional aridity. This case study highlights the benefits of combining fluvial with lacustrine archives to build complementary records of hydrological change in lowland riverine plains.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques have the potential to date these features, but their complex geometry requires careful consideration of the background radiation. Here, we present the first ages for Australian Aboriginal stone construction using single-grain OSL techniques on quartz from stone arrangements in central Australia. Beta and gamma dose rates and the cosmic ray dose have been estimated from mapping the gross geometry of stone and sand courses. The resulting OSL ages are internally consistent and, together with fallout radionuclides 137Cs and 210Pb, indicate a minimum age for construction between 1959 and 1981 AD. We demonstrate that single-grain OSL techniques can be used to determine the age of emplaced sand between stones and, assuming a stable substrate, can be used to date stone building construction as well as building occupation, providing chronologies for sites where organic material for radiocarbon analysis is limited or unavailable.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

That subsequent prehistoric development in the Admiralties was gradual and was not marked by intrusions of significantly different and foreign technology or culture. 3.

Kennedy:2020ninety,"The Ninety-Mile Beach (NMB) barrier system in southeastern Australia is the largest active barrier island system in Australia. The response of a sandy barrier system to a warming climate is dependent on the boundary conditions of sediment supply and sea level. Deposition during the Holocene can therefore provide an indication of how these barriers may change in the future. In this study airborne LiDAR, ground penetrating radar and subsurface coring were combined with 46 optically-stimulated luminescence and 32 radiocarbon ages to provide a detailed understanding of sedimentation of NMB through the Holocene. The barrier complex formed in three distinct phases dating back to the earliest stabilisation of sea level after the Postglacial Marine Transgression. First, restriction of the flooded open-ocean embayment that had formed around a Last Interglacial beach-barrier sequence occurred with accretion of an island complex at around 8000 years BP, sourced from transgressive sands reworked from the shelf. In the second phase, at around 6000 years BP, a second barrier island formed seaward of the Last Interglacial barrier but disconnected from the earlier Holocene barrier islands by a large tidal inlet. Waning sediment supply from the shelf meant that aggradation of these islands slowed by 4000 years BP. The third and final phase occurred after 3000 years with the initiation of sediment supply at the southwestern end of the barrier. The island system which formed seaward of the Last Interglacial barrier then prograded by several hundred metres and elongated in a northeasterly direction by tens of kilometres infilling the tidal inlet and enclosing the earliest Holocene barrier landward of a newly created lake. Sediment supply appears to be the primary limiting factor in the development of NMB with indications of a change in wave climate and sea level have an influence on barrier evolution.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Kermode:2012polycyclic,"Confined river valleys are not the localities where long term preservation of alluvium would be expected. The 25km long low gradient (0.0014m.m-1) confined valley setting of the Shoalhaven River has archived alluvium of middle Pleistocene age to maintain a relatively uniform channel as an efficient conduit for a wide range of flows in a confined bedrock valley of variable morphology. Single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating has identified polycyclic terraces up to 193ka in age (marine isotope stage [MIS] 7) with lower terrace remnants dating from 173-140ka (MIS 6) and 106ka (MIS 5). Holocene alluvium 2-3.5ka in age caps these old Pleistocene units and a well-constrained combination of one-dimensional and two-dimensional hydraulic modelling demonstrates that these polycyclic terraces are clearly within reach of the modern hydrological regime. The 106ka terrace at 17m above low flow is inundated by floods recurring on average every ~20years, and the 140-193ka terraces at 20-22m are overtopped every 50-100years. These ancient diachronous landforms exhibit complex depositional histories and are on-lapped by longitudinal benches of modern sand and gravel. Their polycyclic nature appears to be a response to flow reduction, using alluvium to adjust the boundary of the otherwise inflexible morphology of a bedrock gorge.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Kermode:2013shoalhaven,"With enhanced rates of sea-level rise predicted for the next century, the upstream extent of sea-level influence across coastal plains is a topic of public importance. Australian coastal rivers provide a testing ground for exploring this issue because the area is tectonically stable, was not glaciated, and experienced a Holocene highstand between 7.4 and 2 ka of up to 1.5 m above Australian Height Datum (AHD). In the Shoalhaven River of New South Wales, investigation of a confined bedrock reach at Wogamia, 32 km inland, has identified a unit of dark, cohesive silt and sand with marine diatoms, shell fragments, and enhanced pyrite content, interpreted as estuarine. The unit is up to 13 m thick, thickens downstream, and is overlain by fluvial channel and floodplain deposits. The estuarine unit on-laps a remnant Pleistocene terrace and extends to approximately +2.2 m AHD. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon ages suggest that estuarine deposition commenced prior to 7.8 ka cal bp, predating the highstand by ~ 500 years, and that marine influence in the area continued to 5.3  0.7 ka. During this period, a delta probably persisted at Wogamia, where a narrow upstream reach opens out, and subsequently advanced to fill the broad Shoalhaven coastal embayment. Although the effect of sea-level rise depends on many factors, the results suggest that, during a highstand at or above present sea level, a strong marine influence may extend for tens of kilometres inland and penetrate confined bedrock reaches landward of coastal embayments.

Kermode:2013thesis,"This study examined the mid to late Quaternary landscape evolution of the Shoalhaven River. It aimed to fill the spatial and temporal gaps of existing work which focused on Tertiary evolution in the upstream reaches, and development of the modern deltaic plains. It provides an understanding of fluvial responses to Quaternary climate that may contribute to both theoretical understanding of features and regional catchment management. This thesis, therefore, examines how far upstream Quaternary sea level changes are recorded; how rivers in confined valleys adjust to long-term changes in flow regime; and the structure of in-channel benches as a modern sedimentary process. Key results establish that the sedimentary signature of Holocene sea level rise is preserved tens of kilometres inland and into bedrock-confined reaches. At Wogamia, some 32 km from the current coastline, Holocene estuarine depositional environments extend to 2.2 m above present sea level (AHD). Slightly upstream at Bundanon, where the channel bed lies at approximately -3 m AHD, some ~35 km from the current coastline, a laterally migrating channel with a floodplain built dominantly by vertical overbank deposits is recorded. The absence of estuarine facies at Bundanon is interpreted to relate either to the barrier provided by flow conditions associated with the bedrock constriction downstream, or their removal due to subsequent river-channel migration. Channel migration has occurred since ~4 ka, which coincides with channel stabilisation downstream at Wogamia and the formation of the deltaic plains farther downstream. A significant outcome is the contrast between the long-term preservation of terraces in Bulls Reach with modern inset, in-channel benches. Bulls Reach lies ~7 km upstream, where the channel bed lies at 6 m AHD at the downstream end, and at 18 m AHD at the upstream end. The river in this confined reach has adjusted to changes in flow regime during the Quaternary, and demonstrates a long history of sediment preservation in this lower gorge of the Shoalhaven River. Three of the four sites suggest considerable lateral stability of the river within its valley for up to 200 ka. In addition to these old terraces, the polycyclic depositional history of the alluvium here is reflected by Holocene sediments capping these ancient features, and at lower elevation of longitudinal benches of sand and gravel that have been periodically reworked over much shorter periods. This study finds that deposition and erosion of benches is more complex than accounted for in previous models. Deposition",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Kermode:2015shoalhaven,"Past research has suggested that in-channel alluvial landforms, often termed benches, are associated with flow events with specific return periods and that such landforms are inset within terraces, floodplains, or higher bench surfaces. Chronostratigraphic analysis and hydraulic modelling in a bedrock-confined reach of the lower Shoalhaven River show that they have been extensively eroded and at least partially reformed during the historical period. Lower benches are inundated by flood events with average recurrence intervals (ARI) of 2 or less years, middle benches by events ca. 5years ARI, and upper benches by events ca. 10years ARI. The lower benches commonly share over- or onlapping stratigraphic units, demonstrating that deposition can occur on multiple bench surfaces simultaneously. This is in contrast to earlier suggestions of discrete bench surfaces being associated with, and formed by, events that have a specific return period. In the Shoalhaven River, Pleistocene and Holocene terraces determine the large alluvial channel geometry for a wide range of discharges up to the 50-year return interval with benches forming temporary sediment storages within this larger channel. The large channel dimensions and associated hydraulics and high annual flood variability (flash flood magnitude index of 0.53) for the Shoalhaven River facilitate the construction of multiple bench surfaces across a range of elevations. Benches are formed of a wide range of facies from decimetre-thick massive sand units through interbedded sands and silts.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

They show major changes in local depositional environments and in surrounding dry land vegetation compatible with expected broad palaeoclimatic change. The records are readily interpreted in terms of change in effective precipitation, while there is also evidence of sustained vegetation changes most likely resulting from increased burning through the activities of Aboriginal people. Correlations are complicated by differential sediment accumulation rates including missing and non-polleniferous sections, marked spatial variation in pollen assemblages and a lack of reliable absolute dates for older sediments.

The nature of the open vegetation changed in response to fluctuating climatic conditions and to the increasing magnitude of these oscillations.

Through most of the record, the gross composition of the vegetation, indicated by pollen of drier and wetter rainforests, open sclerophyll vegetation, freshwater swamps and mangroves, changed little although fluctuations did occur that may relate to cyclical changes in climate and sea level. In addition, a reduction in temperatures within the middle Pleistocene might have caused a change in mangrove composition and an increase in higher-altitude taxa, particularly ferns. Evidence exists for the disappearance or reduction in range of a number of gymnosperms throughout the record. Earlier disappearances were probably caused by increased climatic variability and correspond with those elsewhere in Australia. The replacement of araucarian drier forest by open sclerophyll vegetation and the extinction of a species of Dacrydium may relate to an increase in burning caused by the activities of Aboriginal people. The initiation of this change is dated between -150 and 100 k.y. ago, well before the date for a similar change in terrestrial records from the region. However, the date is in line with that from Lake George in southeastern Australia and adds substantially to the evidence of a very early time of arrival of Aborigines and for their impact on the Australian landscape.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

This site has yielded a continuous, detailed pollen record through the last ca. 140,000 years and revealed marked vegetation and environmental changes at orbital to sub-millennial scales. Radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL, or optical) ages provide some chronological control for the last ca. 70,000 years. Most of the sediment is inorganic but with well preserved pollen that accumulated under unproductive and probably largely ice-covered lake conditions. The lake was surrounded by low-growing plants with an alpine character. Exceptions include three discrete periods of high organic sedimentation in the basin and forest development in the surrounding catchment. The two major periods of forest expansion are related to the last interglacial and the Holocene, with the third, shorter period considered to represent an interstadial in the early part of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The latter part of the last glacial period is characterised by abrupt sub-millennial, amelioration events that may relate to documented global oscillations emanating from the North Atlantic.

Kim:2016korean,"Tectonically inactive since the middle Miocene, the Korean Peninsula is generally considered a typical passive continental margin with asymmetric relief with only low levels of seismic activity. Recent reports of uplift rates as high as 150–350 mm ka− 1 from geomorphic markers using numerical dating methods (e.g. radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and cosmogenic nuclides), however, cast doubt on the tectonic quies- cence of Korea. Thus, we evaluate the geomorphic status of eastern Korea using denudation rates at geomorphic timescales of 103–106 years, which are equivalent to the rates previously reported at local points. To infer regional denudation rates, we measured catchment-wide denudation rates (CWDR) in 13 watersheds using in situ cos- mogenic 10Be and 14C analyses of riverine sediment samples in eastern Korea. These CWDR data suggest that the mean denudation rate during the past 5–14 ka centers around ~74.7 ± 25.4 mm·ka−1, which is consistent with the long-term, geologic exhumation rate we derive of ~74 ± 10.1 mm·ka−1 since the middle Miocene. However, our CWDR data are ~2–3 times lower than rates of coastal uplift and river incision of 150–350 mm·ka− 1 derived from data on marine and fluvial terraces, respectively.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Kim:2017seti,"The concentration of cosmogenic 10Be in riverine sediments has been widely used as a proxy for catchment-wide denudation rate (CWDR). One of the key assumptions of this approach is that sediments originating from sub-basins with different erosional histories are well mixed. A tragic debris flow occurred in the Seti River watershed, central Nepal, on May 5, 2012. This catastrophic debris flow was triggered by slope failure on the peak of Annapurna IV and resulted in many casualties in the lower Seti Khola. However, it provided an opportunity to test the assumption of equal mixing of sediments in an understudied rapidly eroding watershed. This study documents the CWDR of 10Be to evaluate the extent of the influence of episodic erosional processes such as debris flow on the spatio-temporal redistribution of 10Be concentrations. Our data show that the debris flow caused little change in CWDR across the debris flow event. In addition to isotopic measurement, we calculated denudation rates by using the modeled concentrations in pre- and post-landslide sediments based on the local 10Be production rate. The modeled result showed little change across the event, indicating that the debris flow in May 2012 played a minor role in sediment evacuation, despite the rapid erosion in the catchment. Our study concludes that although the 2012 event caused many casualties and severe damage, it was a low-magnitude, high frequency event.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Compared to the geologic history of the flanking extensional basin, which is well known from analysis of its sedimentary fill, the post-extensional geomorphic history of the escarpment and basin margin has been minimally studied because of a lack of terrestrial archives. We determined the rate and cause of divide migration of the TBR using a suite of relatively new geomorphic and geochronologic tools. We used geomorphic analyses of relief, slope, river long profiles, swath profiles, and x parameters to study this transient topography.

Kirby:2013kunlun,"Whether active strain within the Indo-Asian collision zone is primarily localized along major strike-slip fault systems or is distributed throughout the intervening crust between faults remains uncertain. Despite refined estimates of slip rates along many of the major fault zones, relatively little is known about how displacement along these structures is accommodated at fault terminations. Here, we show that a systematic decrease in left-lateral slip rates along the eastern ~200 km of the Kunlun fault, from >10 mm/year to <1 mm/year, is coincident with high topography in the Anyemaqen Shan and with a broad zone of distributed shear and clockwise vorticity within the Tibetan Plateau. Geomorphic analysis of river longitudinal profiles, coupled with inventories of cosmogenic radionuclides in fluvial sediment, reveal correlated variations in fluvial relief and erosion rate across the Anyemaqen Shan that reflect ongoing differential rock uplift across the range. Our results imply that the termination of the Kunlun fault system is accommodated by a combination of distributed crustal thickening and by clockwise rotation of the eastern fault segments.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Kirch:2021talepakemalai,"The Lapita Cultural Complex-first uncovered in the mid-20th century as a widespread archaeological complex spanning both Melanesia and Western Polynesia-has subsequently become recognized as of fundamental importance to Oceanic prehistory. Notable for its highly distinctive, elaborate, dentate-stamped pottery, Lapita sites date to between 3500-2700 BP, spanning the geographic range from the Bismarck Archipelago to Tonga and Samoa. The Lapita culture has been interpreted as the archaeological manifestation of a diaspora of Austronesian-speaking people (specifically of Proto-Oceanic language) who rapidly expanded from Near Oceania (the New Guinea-Bismarcks region) into Remote Oceania, where no humans had previously ventured. Lapita is thus a foundational culture throughout much of the southwestern Pacific, ancestral to much of the later, ethnographically-attested cultural diversity of the region. The Mussau materials are essential to understanding how Lapita developed and was transformed during the period prior to and following the Lapita diaspora into Remote Oceania.

Kober:2009lluta,"Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) concentrations measured in river sediments can be used to estimate catchment‐wide denudation rates. By investigating multiple TCN the steadiness of sediment generation, transport and depositional processes can be tested. Measurements of 10Be, 21Ne and 26Al from the hyper‐ to semi‐arid Rio Lluta catchment, northern Chile, yield average single denudation rates ranging from 12 to 75 m Myr–1 throughout the catchment. Paired nuclide analysis reveals complex exposure histories for most of the samples and thus the single nuclide estimates do not exclusively represent catchment‐wide denudation rates. The lower range of single nuclide denudation rates (12–17 m Myr–1), established with the noble gas 21Ne, is in accordance with palaeodenudation rates derived from 21Ne/10Be and 26Al/10Be ratio analysis. Since this denudation rate range is measured throughout the system, it is suggested that a headwater signal is transported downstream but modulated by a complex admixture of sediment that has been stored and buried at proximal hillslope or terrace deposits, which are released during high discharge events. That is best evidenced by the stable nuclide 21Ne, which preserves the nuclide concentration even during storage intervals. The catchment‐wide single 21Ne denudation rates and the palaeodenuation rates contrast with previous TCN‐derived erosion rates from bedrock exposures at hillslope interfluves by being at least one order of magnitude higher, especially in the lower river course. These results support earlier studies that identified a coupling of erosional processes in the Western Cordillera contrasting with decoupled processes in the Western Escarpment and in the Coastal Cordillera.

Kober:2012debris,"Catchment-wide denudation rates (CWDRs) obtained from cosmogenic nuclides are an efficient way to determine geomorphic processes quantitatively in alpine mountain ranges over Holocene time scales. These rate estimations assume steady geomorphic processes. Here we use a time series (3 yr) in the Aare catchment (central Swiss Alps) to test the impact of spatially heterogeneous stochastic sediment supply on CWDRs. Our results show that low-frequency, high-magnitude debris-flow events significantly perturb cosmogenic nuclide (10Be, 14C) concentrations and thus CWDRs. The 10Be concentrations decrease by a factor of two following debris-flow events, resulting in a doubling of inferred CWDRs. The variability indicates a clear time and source dependency on sediment supply, with restricted area-weighted mixing of sediment. Accordingly, in transient environments, it is critical to have an understanding of the history of geomorphic processes to derive meaningful CWDRs. We hypothesize that the size of debris flows, their connectivity with the trunk stream, and the ability of the system to sufficiently mix sediment from low- and high-order catchments control the magnitude of CWDR perturbations. We also determined in situ 14C in a few samples. In conjunction with 10Be, these data suggest partial storage for colluvium of a few thousand years within the catchment prior to debris-flow initiation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here, we investigate the Rio Grande catchment which crosses orthogonally the eastern Andes orogen from the Eastern Cordillera into the Subandean Zone, exhibiting a catchment relief of up to 5000 m. Despite an enhanced tectonic activity in the Subandes, local relief, mean and modal slopes and channel steepness indices are largely similar compared to the Eastern Cordillera and the intervening Interandean Zone. Nevertheless, a dataset of 57 new cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al catchment wide denudation rates from the Rio Grande catchment reveals up to one order of magnitude higher denudation rates in the Subandean Zone (mean 0.8 mm/yr) compared to the upstream physiographic regions.

Kodela:1996thesis,"The Robertson Plateau is a near-coastal upland region forming part of the Central Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, 34°35'S, 150°35'£. The study area occurs approximately 100 km south of Sydney. Much of the natural vegetation on the basaltand shale-derived soils around Robertson was cleared for agriculture, leaving a landscape of fragmented forest within pastures, flanked by less disturbed sandstone vegetation to the north, east and south. In the Robertson region fertile basaltic soils and a mean annual rainfall over 1600 mm support mixed cool temperate/warm temperate rainforest, remnants of the formerly more continuous and widespread Yarrawa Brush. Other vegetation communities investigated include open/tall open eucalypt forests and wetlands, as well as disturbed forests and open pastures. Vegetation types were described, including the compilation of species lists. The association of rainforest being close to several peatlands on the Robertson Plateau provided a good opportunity to study vegetation and environmental change, especially when rainforest vegetation is generally more sensitive to environmental conditions and changes than the more resilient eucalypt forests and sandstone flora in the Sydney Basin. Sediment studies applying a multidisciplinary approach were undertaken to investigate the late Holocene vegetation and environmental history of the Robertson Plateau region. Pollen analysis was employed in conjunction with radiocarbon dating, stratigraphy, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility and carbonised particle analysis of sediment cores extracted from Wingecarribee Swamp and Wildes Meadow Swamp. A modem pollen rain study, in conjunction with vegetation survey and a pollen morphology investigation, were first undertaken to assist with the identification of pollen and the interpretation of fossil pollen records. Pollen morphological descriptions are provided for 66 plant taxa that occur in rainforest and open-forest communities in the Illawarra region, including the Robertson Plateau and the Illawarra escarpment and coastal plain. The study provides some insight on the features useful for pollen identification, as well  as problems that may be encountered when differentiating pollen of related taxa. This information may be useful to palynological investigations and plant taxonomic studies. The modem pollen spectra for Eucalyptus forest and rainforest communities were investigated from 19 sites. Pollen abundance was compared with a number of plant abundance estimates of taxa within forests to study pollen representation at the forest scale. Linear regression, cluster and discriminant analyses were applied to analyse pollen representation and distribution. Pollen of Doryphora, Polyosma, Pittosporum, Hymenanthera, Tasmannia, Asclepiadaceae and most rainforest taxa investigated are poorly represented, while many open-ground and some sclerophyll taxa, particularly Eucalyptus, are better represented. Hedycarya, Cyathea and Dicksonia tended to be over-represented while Acmena was found to be well or under-represented by its pollen. The pollen of many native taxa do not appear to be well dispersed, and local pollen is commonly outweighed by pollen from regional sources, including pollen from pastures in the region. Pollen representation varied between taxa and sites, with factors such as vegetation structure, plant distribution, topography and disturbance influencing pollen representation. The influence of environmental conditions and vegetation attributes on pollen production, dispersal and preservation will affect pollen representation as these properties vary in space and time. This variability in the representation of the same taxon due to non-uniform environmental and vegetation conditions suggests that caution is needed when interpreting trends in pollen assemblages. Peat formation occurred more rapidly after 3500 b.p. and 2500-2000 b.p. at Wildes Meadow Swamp and Wingecarribee Swamp, respectively. About the same time, rainforest appears to have expanded in the region. Eucalyptus appears to have been more prevalent prior to this later phase of wetland and rainforest development. Generally higher amounts of Eucalyptus pollen and fem spores before c. 2000 y.a. in the Wingecarribee Swamp cores indicate moist eucalypt forest (or tall open-forest) with a fem understorey may have been more widespread in the past ( at least within the local region) and that rainforest may have expanded into these communities. Other aspects of the late Holocene vegetation dynamics are also discussed, including changes in wetland vegetation. The results contribute to a wider understanding of regional changes in southeastem Australia. The main development of peat in the Robertson Plateau region corresponds with other findings on mire development in upland sites that suggest effectively wetter conditions in highland areas of southeastem Australia in the late Holocene. Disturbance by European settlement is clearly indicated in the more recent pollen record by a decline in native forest taxa, the introduction of exotic species and increases in Poaceae and other taxa associated with agriculture. ...

Koehler:2021inskip,"This paper presents a reconstruction of the Holocene evolution of the Inskip Peninsula in SE Queensland. The peninsula links two major dune fields, the Cooloola Sand Mass to the south and K'gari (Fraser Island) to the north. Geomorphic features of this peninsula include remnant parabolic dunes, numerous beach ridges with foredunes, and a series of spits. Together these features provide insight into Holocene coastal evolution and changing marine conditions. A remnant beach ridge/foredune complex at the northern portion of Inskip may have been connected to K'gari and a river/tidal channel near Rainbow Beach township which separated it from the Cooloola Sand Mass to the south. This channel avulsed northward in the early mid-Holocene (after 8.8 ka) with spit development from the south. This was followed by a phase of beach-ridge/foredune complex development that started by ~6.7 ka. Stratigraphic evidence from the highest and best developed parabolic dunes in the northern portion of Inskip Peninsula indicates dune development from the mid-Holocene beach complex by 4.8 ka. Beach ridges with foredunes continued to prograde but notably declined in size during the late-Holocene. In the latest Holocene (<4.8 ka) many of the late-Holocene beach ridges/foredune complexes have been truncated by a re-orientation of the shoreline and longshore sediment transport has promoted the growth of the modern spit at the northern end of the peninsula. Erosive and longshore processes continue to be highly active because of tidal interactions between Great Sandy Strait and the Coral Sea. This detailed study of Inskip Peninsula's evolution aids significantly in future coastal management decisions, and provides evidence for World Heritage Area extension for the Cooloola Sand Mass, including the incorporation of Inskip Peninsula itself.

Kohen:1986thesis,"The stdy of prehistory is subject to the same bias and prejudice as any other scientific discipline. When the rewards are likely to be few and the effort required great, researchers will avoid problem areas in favour of more lucrative fields. One such neglected area of research has been the archaeology of the coastal plains and forests of southeastern Australia, where poor visibility and the diffuse nature of the archaaeological record militate against the investment of valuable research time. In the Sydney region, the archaeological data accumulated relate almost exclusively to rock shelter deposits. While such sites do have the potential to provide a great deal of valuable information, they reflect only a fraction of the activities carried out by the prehistoric population. In order to counteract the bias evident in the archaeological investigations, I undertook a systematic archaeological survey of the western Cumberland Plain. In the early chapters of this thesis, I examine the environmental setting and the resources which were available to Aboriginal people at the time of European settlement in 1788. After evaluating the ethnographic accouns, a clear picture emerges of two major economic systems operating; one based on coastal resources and one reliant on a wider range of locally abundant foods. Associate with this dichotomy were linguistic, technological and social differences suggestive of dense Aboriginal populations exploiting relatively narrow territories. Archaeological surveys were undertaken, a representative rockshelter site and two open sites were excavated, and, in conjunction with the surface collection of artefacts, it was possible to identify patterns in the archaeological record suggesting that the technological changes evident in the stone tools were a reflection of a changing resource base. In the final chapters, te factors which have influenced the location of sites and the distribution of artefact types are examined, and a model proposed which accounts for the observed data. The model suggests that macropodids formed a major component of the diet for several thousand years following the introdution of a microlithic industry, but that over the last 2,000 years increasing Aboriginal population has necessitated a diversification into a wider range of resources.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

Sample preparation was done in the Spectrum analytical facility of the Faculty of Science at the University of Johannesburg, the chemical separation was carried out in the ultraclean Wits Isotope Geology Laboratory (WIGL) at the University of the Witwatersrand, and the AMS analyses were carried out at iThemba Labs in Johannesburg. The chemical separation procedure makes use of two successive ion exchange column steps: The first employs an anion ion exchange resin and the second a cation exchange resin. The second one in particular required careful calibration, which was done for two column volumes (1and 2 ml resin respectively), using inductively coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES) spectroscopy. The samples analyzed comprised six stream sediments taken in rivers draining the eastern Escarpment to determine catchment-wide erosion rates, as well as five rock samples taken from outcrops close to the escarpment crest, for comparison. ...

Korup:2014flux,"Quantifying volumes and rates of delivery of terrestrial sediment from island arcs to subduction zones is indispensable for refining estimates of the thickness of trench fills that may eventually control the location and timing of submarine landslides and tsunami-generating mega-earthquakes. Despite these motivating insights, knowledge about the rates of erosion and sediment export from the Japanese islands to their Pacific subduction zones remains patchy regardless of the increasing availability of highly resolved data on surface deformation, climate, geology, and topography. Traditionally, natural erosion rates across the island arc have been estimated from regression of topographic catchment metrics and reservoir sedimentation rates that were recorded over several years to decades. We review current research in this context, correct for a systematic bias in one of the most widely used predictions, and present new estimates of decadal to millennial-scale erosion rates of Japan's terrestrial inner forearc. We draw on several independent and unprecedented inventories of mass wasting, reservoir sedimentation, and concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be in river sands.  ...

Ladd:1978curlip,"The Lake Curlip swamp is part of the Snowy River flats and is covered mainly by Phragmites grassland and Melaleuca thickets. The land bordering the flats is generally cleared, but there are some open-forests dominated by eucalypts, and small patches of Acmena closed-forest occur in sheltered sites on the flats or in gullies. Sediments from a core taken from the swamp cover the period 5200 B.P. to present. From 5200 B.P. to about 1500 B.P., the pollen record shows very little change, but from 1500B.P. to thepresent, swamp plant pollen proportions undergo marked fluctuations. Most of the sediments under the Lake Curlip swamp were deposited under saline water; pollen and spores in the sediments were derived mainly from the Snowy and Brodribb Rivers, which flowed into a large common estuary. After 1700 B.P., the water over the core site became fresher, hydrosere succession followed, culminating in the growth of a Melaleuca ericifolia closed-scrub. Water-borne pollen and spores were eliminated from the site, but have recently been reintroduced with flood waters from the Brodribb Channel. The pollen record from Lake Curlip swamp suggests that there has been little change in the distribution of dry-land vegetation in this area. From this it must be concluded that the climate in the past 5200 years has been quite similar to that of the present.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Ladd:1992flinders,"Two swamp sites on Flinders Island in Bass Strait provide evidence of vegetation cover for the period 10000 BP to present. Steppe vegetation in which Compositae Liguliflorae taxa and chenopods were important was present on the Flinders Island part of the Bassian Isthmus during the earliest part of the record. However, it was replaced by eucalypt forest or woodland with a grassy understorey and some shrubs as sea level rose to form the present island by 6000 BP. The eucalypt dominated vegetation became less important about 940 BP when Callitris became prominent until very recently. This change may be related to a drier climate. Flinders Island is one of the few sites in Australia where humans were absent for an extended time (c. 4700 to 200 BP) during the Holocene. There is no particular indication of pollen or charcoal changes which can be related to the disappearance of humans from the island. However, at Killiecrankie Swamp the arrival of Europeans 200 yr ago probably caused the mcreased charcoal input to the swamp sediments and the vegetation change observed. Likewise Middle Patriarch Swamp records changes due to clearing and swamp drainage in the most recent times. The fact that the swamp deposits contain charcoal and pollen, together with the density of swamps on the eastern side of the island means the area is very favourably placed to provide detailed information on firing regimes unaffected by humans, in a sclerophyll vegetation very similar to that in large areas of southeastern Australia. In the light of the pollen evidence from this study and that from other southeastern mainland and Tasmanian sites it is suggested that the apparent prominence of Casuarina in the southwest of Victoria and southeast of South Australia during the early Holocene was due to local soil factors and drier climate. Later changes in soil and climate led to a decrease in Casuarina and increase in Eucalyptus.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

It does, however, exhibit some similarity to art in regions to the east and the west of the plateau. Subject to further archaeological testing, we present a number of exploratory hypotheses with which to explain the presence of the engravings; as part of the ethnographic and contemporary Kasua’s cultural suite; as part of a relatively recent (late Holocene) migration of peoples from the Gulf to the plateau; or as part of an earlier movement of people from the west, possibly as part of the movement of people into the Sahul continent in the Late Pleistocene.

We present a 120-year record of vegetation and fire regime change from Gunaikurnai Country, southeast Australia. Our data demonstrate that catastrophic bushfires first impacted the local area immediately following the prohibition of settler burning in 1970, which allowed a rapid increase in flammable eucalypts that resulted in the onset of catastrophic bushfires.

The flaked stone industry was a simple one, consisting mainly of utilized flakes of non-specialized character, but with two elouera in the lowest level. Faunal remains show that food was derived almost entirely from the sea and the suite of artefacts reflects this specialized type of economy. Examination of the bone points in conjunction with those originating from both ethnographic and archaeological situations elsewhere in Eastern Australia, indicates that the Durras North bone point industry was peculiar to its locality and contrasts with that found at a number of other sites of comparable date.

These differences have been attributed to either low population densities during the Pleistocene or the loss of behavioural ‘traits‘ on the journey from Africa to Sahul.

Larsen:2011eyre,"The availability of surface water resources is of fundamental concern globally, especially in dryland environments where these resources are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation. Determining the extent and quality of this water also requires some knowledge about the susceptibility of these resources to change. This thesis aims to improve our understanding of the water balance in dryland environments, in particular within the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) in central Australia, both in terms of modern processes and the factors that may have resulted in changing hydrological conditions during the Late Quaternary. The dissolved load in the contemporary dryland rivers of the LEB is assessed and indicates that evaporation does not significantly modify the ionic content or solute concentration despite large transmission losses to the surface water budget (~64% of mean annual flow). The source of these solutes is investigated and shows that although rainfall and dust account for the bulk of them, silicate weathering also plays a surprisingly important role. This suggests that dryland environments should also be included estimates of the global silicate-weathering cycle. A comprehensive investigation into the cause and fate of the large catchment transmission losses, and their role in the water budget within the LEB is undertaken. The semi-confined alluvial setting caused by the large mud-dominated multiple channel and floodplain system in many parts of the LEB, and in particular the Channel Country of Cooper Creek, has resulted in at least three distinct shallow groundwater recharge pathways. These control recharge rates, the distribution of freshwater lenses, and the evolution of high groundwater salinities. This highlights the importance of preferential flow in semi-confined alluvial settings, and suggests that where hydrological variability is typically high, such as dryland environments, groundwater recharge is perhaps better considered as a probability of occurrence instead as an average rate. Furthermore, the sum of these probabilities may in turn best account for the observed transmission losses in the water budget. The current hydrology of the LEB is complex, making it difficult to interpret the conditions that prevailed during the dramatic changes in climate and hydrology associated with the Late Quaternary. This aspect of the study investigates runoff conditions required to maintain the system of terminal lakes. Strzelecki Creek, a distributary of Cooper Creek originating at Innamincka, has a record of fluvial deposition that broadly matches the fillings of the Lake Mega-Frome system. This confirms the ability of the headwaters of the LEB to deliver runoff",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The lack of soil production and weathering rate measurements in Earth’s most rapidly uplifting mountains has made it difficult to determine whether weathering rates increase or decline in response to rapid erosion. Beryllium-10 concentrations in soils from the western Southern Alps, New Zealand, demonstrate that soil is produced from bedrock more rapidly than previously recognized, at rates up to 2.5 millimeters per year. Weathering intensity data further indicate that soil chemical denudation rates increase proportionally with erosion rates.

Lawler:2014birrarrung,"Birrarrung Park in Lower Templestowe occupies an alluvial floodplain within a great bend of the Yarra River, at its confluence with the Plenty River. The terrace deposits at this location have not been previously dated, but are believed to comprise one or more Holocene terraces with earlier Pleistocene terraces overlying Tertiary gravels and clays. Severe erosion at the mouth of an outfall drain at the eastern side of the park has created a large chasm through the terrace deposits, more than eight metres in depth. To manage potential Aboriginal cultural heritage which may be affected by its planned restitution program, the City of Manningham commissioned a Cultural Heritage Management Plan (CHMP) prior to the commencement of these works. One concern was the possibility that deeply buried archaeological deposits might occur within the terrace sediments which would be impacted by the works. Archaeological investigations, which yielded OSL age estimates, have shown that this portion of the river terrace was formed during the latter part of the previous interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage 5), from 105 + 8.4 to 81.2 + 1.6 thousand years ago. The sediments were laid down during two warmer accretionary stages (MIS5c and MIS5a), separated by a colder transgressive phase (MIS5b). Because the Pleistocene terrace was formed before any known human occupation in Australia, there is no likelihood that any deeply buried archaeological deposits would occur within the terrace sediments. Beyond the immediate requirements of the CHMP, the study contributes to our understanding of the river's Pleistocene development.

A combination of radiometric dating, historical data, fossil markers and mineral magnetics has been used to develop a sediment chronology for the billabong that extends from about ad 1120 to the present. Fossil pollen and diatoms have been used to provide a high-resolution record of vegetation and aquatic ecosystem change through this period, with the aim of developing a better understanding of human disturbance in floodplain lakes. Specifically we aim to investigate the development and trajectory of eutrophic and turbid conditions that exist in the lake at present. The pre-European contact diatom assemblage at Bolin Billabong is dominated by a planktonic taxon, Cyclotella stelligera, and had very low diversity, with little evidence of species turnover. This suggests that the billabong had low nutrient concentrations and contrasts with the generally accepted notion of billabongs as naturally diverse, productive and variable systems. The initial period of European occupation was characterized by catchment disturbance with high levels of erosion and sedimentation. Sedimentation rates in the post-European contact period appear to be 30 times higher than prior to European settlement. Evidence suggests that the Yarra River was not naturally turbid. Changes to the diatom assemblage, reflective of water quality perturbation following European contact, were dramatic and unprecedented. Following an initially high sedimentation rate in the post-European contact period, the sedimentation rate gradually slowed towards the present day. The increase in nutrients available to the diatom assemblage appears to have been moderate from European contact (c. AD 1840) to until around AD 1920, then more pronounced from this point onwards.

New Ireland contains the earliest radiocarbon determinations for human occupation and therefore provides an opportunity to investigate colonisation. It also has a depauperate fauna compared to New Guinea and therefore provides an opportunity to investigate subsequent human adaptations. Hunting strategies are investigated through an analysis of the Buang Merabak faunal assemblage. The Buang Merabak assemblage contains prehistoric food refuse including shell and bone midden material and stone artefacts. The results of the faunal analysis are interpreted to investigate issues of resource use, land use and mobility. Resource use is reflected through prey selectivity and provides the opportunity to investigate the nature of hunting specialisation as a mechanism of adaptation. Prey taxa have discrete ecological requirements that are the parameters of their spatial distribution across the island. Notions of human land use are reflected through the spatial distribution of the prey taxa and are interpreted as a reflection of both on site and off site activities. In order to exploit each particular taxon the hunter must interact with the prey within the prey‘s environment. Therefore within the hunting context, human land use is reflected by the prey they capture and bring back to the site.  ... [_truncated_]",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2023-01-11 09:28:47.559 +0100

Along the easternmost part of the Bogd fault, six forebergs have formed in the foreland of the Artz Bogd restraining-bend. We surveyed one of these forebergs to ascertain the fault geometry associated with its formation and understand how it has developed over time. ..",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Legrain:2015alps,"In the debate on the causes of uplift and landscape evolution of the Alps, most studies focus on regions that were glaciated at some stage during the last 2 m.y. In these areas, it is difficult to separate glacial-driven versus tectonically driven rates of erosion. Here, we present 10Be-derived erosion rates from unglaciated catchments in the Koralpe range at the eastern end of the Alps. This region features strong geomorphologic evidence for landscape transience with young valleys incised into a smooth relict landscape. Erosion rates average 49 ± 8 mm/k.y. for catchments located on the relict landscape and 137 ± 15 mm/k.y. for catchments in the incised landscape. From these data, we estimate the onset of incision at 4 ± 1 Ma, the surface uplift at 350 ± 90 m, and a total relative base-level fall of 540 ± 140 m. Our results are in close agreement with both the magnitude and the age of onset of uplift of the Styrian Basin and the northern Molasse Basin, as well as the incision rate of the Mur River into the Styrian karst. The inferred timing of the onset of uplift around 4 Ma relates to interpreted basin inversion in the Pannonian Basin. Since this uplift event appears to have involved both the Pannonian Basin and the entire eastern end of the Alpine mountain range, we suggest that it may have occurred in response to a deep-seated process in the lithosphere. As such, we argue for tectonic drivers for the post-Miocene uplift in the eastern Alps.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Lenard:2020steady,"Sediment accumulation rates and thermal trackers suggest a substantial and global increase in erosion rates over the past few million years. That increase is commonly associated with the impact of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation, but methodological biases have led researchers to debate this hypothesis. Here, we test whether Himalayan erosion rates increased by measuring beryllium-10 (10Be) in the sediment of the Bengal Bay seabed. Sediment originated from rocks that produced 10Be under the impact of cosmic rays during erosion near surface. Thus, the 10Be concentrations indicate erosion rates. The 10Be concentration of the Bengal Bay sediment depends on the contributions of the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers. Their sediments have distinct 10Be concentrations because of distinct elevations and erosion in their drainage basins. Variable contributions could thus complicate erosion-rate calculation. We traced these contributions by a provenance study using the strontium (Sr) and neodymium (Nd) isotopic sediment compositions. Within uncertainties of ±30%, our reconstructed past erosion rates show no long-term increase for the past six million years. This stability suggests that climatic changes during the late Cenozoic have an undetectable impact on the erosion patterns in the Himalayas, at least on the ten thousand to million year timescales accounted for by our dataset.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Lentfer:2007holocene,"An integrated approach to the reconstruction of vegetation history and human land use during the Holocene on Garua Island, Papua New Guinea analysed sediments and plant microfossils (phytoliths and starch granules) together with archaeological data. The long-term record is punctuated by a series of volcanic disasters, where repeated cycles of massive destruction were followed by differing cycles of forest regeneration. The plant microfossil record shows that instead of long-term forest recovery, the overall pattern of regeneration was progressively more disrupted. Through time regeneration was halted earlier in the sequence and then reverted to increasingly open plant communities dominated by grasses. The temporal patterns of burning, stone artefact discard, and plant introductions demonstrate that the increased impact of human systems of land management was primarily responsible for the temporal patterning. Most notably, the study shows that human interference begins much earlier than expected given previous archaeological research and relatively intensive burning and landscape modification, possibly indicating cultivation, predates the introduction of Lapita pottery.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Lentfer:2010natural,"Phytoliths and micro-charcoal from the Yombon Airstrip archaeological site in central New Britain, Papua New Guinea, provide the longest vegetation history record yet available for the New Guinea islands. The record begins about 35 kya with the first evidence for human presence at the site and, with the exception of the Last Glacial Maximum period, is continuous to the present. Three other sites provide supplementary evidence, including plant macro-remains, from the early Holocene onwards. The record is punctuated by a series of volcanic events, which are reflected in the vegetation record by alternating frequencies of closed forest and regrowth elements. Micro-charcoal is present from the oldest levels and fluctuates in frequency throughout the sequence, increasing substantially from the terminal Pleistocene early Holocene onwards. This coincides with the first appearance of panicoid grasses and a range of potential cultivars including bananas and Saccharum. Increased levels of burning coinciding with the appearance of potential plant cultivars may indicate shifts in plant food production leading to cultivation from the early Holocene onwards. This compares favourably with previously reported evidence from Garua Island off the north coast of New Britain. The combination of trends in burning, vegetation clearance and appearance of potential cultivars on New Britain appears to parallel changes in the Papua New Guinea highlands at a similar time, and suggests regional similarities in subsistence and vegetation management practices from before the LGM onwards. Further studies are needed to clarify the timing and extent of these shifts across the region, and to provide a vegetation picture for the period before human colonisation of New Britain.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The numerous middens, stone arrangements and art sites on Lizard Island suggest longterm use by Indigenous people, but recent discoveries of pottery give tantalising glimpses of a prehistoric past that may have included a prehistoric economy involving pottery. Here we review previous archaeological surveys and studies on Lizard Island and report on new archaeological and palaeoenvironmental studies from the Site 17 midden at Freshwater Beach, with an oldest date of 3815–3571 cal BP. We identify two major changes in the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records, one associated with more recent European influences and the other at c.2000 cal BP.

The artefact, which is made from coralline limestone, is interpreted as a nut-cracking anvil. AMS dating places its use at approximately 2800 calBP, in Middle–Late Lapita times, and provides the first direct confirmation of Lapita-age use of nut-cracking tools.

Leonard:2015daintree,"The dramatic decline in the quality of coral reef cover of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) over recent decades has resulted in targeted research to better understand the dynamics of sedimentary sources within river systems of Northeastern Australia. European land-use practices are thought to have increased sediment yields to the GBR lagoon by 5–10 times, yet there is a poor understanding of the pre-1850 sediment dynamics. This study presents the first detailed alluvial chronology of the spatial and temporal responses of fluvial systems in the Wet Tropics of Northeastern Australia over the late Holocene. Valley fill sequences of the Daintree River, one of the least disturbed catchments draining to the GBR lagoon, are examined to investigate the significance of floodplain dynamics in sedimentary process. An optically stimulated luminescence chronology combined with a detailed sedimentary analysis suggests that floodplain stripping is a major, and hitherto unrecognised, source of sediment. Furthermore, rates of floodplain accretion are far greater than has been previously estimated from sediment modelling for wet tropical catchments. Spatial analysis of the topographical relationships between floodplain morphological units suggests that a total of 178,516 ton/ha of sediment has been stripped from three small confined floodplain reaches between 1038  215 and 99  10 years. Evidence suggests that these erosion events are followed by phases of rapid accretion with an average depositional rate of 3.87  0.92 cm/yr between 572  74 and 51  12 years across the study area. The floodplain appears to be in a constant state of disequilibrium, experiencing spatially discontinuous phases of erosion and aggradation resulting in much higher volumes of sediment being redistributed within the catchment than previously considered. The unpredictable nature of these regimes and the shear volume of sediment mobilised poses significant challenges in managing sediment sources to the GBR lagoon.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Leonard:2016holocene,"The sedimentology, geomorphology and chronology of late Quaternary fluvial landforms and sedimentary sequences within the Mulgrave River catchment in northeast Queensland suggest that episodic stripping or wholesale erosion of Holocene floodplains is a major mode of sediment delivery to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. The last major phase of Holocene valley sediment removal likely occurred sometime between approximately 1200 and 250 years ago and was possibly associated with a phase of heightened tropical cyclone activity and consequent riverine flooding that occurred between AD1400 and 1800. Since then relative tropical cyclone quiescence may be the cause of a phase of valley aggradation that has been occurring over the past two centuries. The results of this investigation suggest that in this catchment there have been alternating phases of Holocene valley floodplain stripping and subsequent aggradation, with the latter being the current dominant mode. This suggests that at least here, in this relatively confined valley, sediment delivery to the Great Barrier Reef may be relatively low compared to other periods over the past millennium and this may be due to low levels of tropical cyclone activity over the past 200 years.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Its geometry is a key parameter that influences accommodation of tectonic loading and earthquake magnitudes along the Himalayan Arc. Although seismic images are available for both the western and the central part of the range, this geometry remains poorly constrained for the Bhutanese Himalayas. Here we address this issue using a 10Be cosmogenic nuclides denudation transect across western Bhutan. We observe a wide low denudation rate domain between 50 km and 110 km from the front followed by a strong northward increase. Using a joint inversion of denudation rates, GPS data, and Holocene uplift rates, we interpret this pattern as a consequence of a flat‐ramp transition along the MHT. Compared to central Nepal and Sikkim, this location of the ramp suggests a wider décollement, with implications for greater seismogenic potential of the MHT in western Bhutan.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Letnic:2012killing,"Invasive predators can impose strong selection pressure on species that evolved in their absence and drive species to extinction. Interactions between coexisting predators may be particularly strong, as larger predators frequently kill smaller predators and suppress their abundances. Until 3500 years ago the marsupial thylacine was Australia's largest predator. It became extinct from the mainland soon after the arrival of a morphologically convergent placental predator, the dingo, but persisted in the absence of dingoes on the island of Tasmania until the 20th century. As Tasmanian thylacines were larger than dingoes, it has been argued that dingoes were unlikely to have caused the extinction of mainland thylacines because larger predators are rarely killed by smaller predators. By comparing Holocene specimens from the same regions of mainland Australia, we show that dingoes were similarly sized to male thylacines but considerably larger than female thylacines. Female thylacines would have been vulnerable to killing by dingoes. Such killing could have depressed the reproductive output of thylacine populations. Our results support the hypothesis that direct killing by larger dingoes drove thylacines to extinction on mainland Australia. However, attributing the extinction of the thylacine to just one cause is problematic because the arrival of dingoes coincided with another the potential extinction driver, the intensification of the human economy.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Lewis:2014history,"Understanding the key processes controlling the delivery, deposition and fate of sediments on continental shelves is critical to appreciate the evolution of coasts and estuaries and to interpret geological sequences. This study presents radiocarbon and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) ages of sediment cores collected from key locations offshore from the Burdekin River, Australia, the largest single source of sediment delivered to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. The ages show variable sediment accumulation rates at the different locations that coincide with the Holocene avulsion history of the Burdekin River. Our data show that most fine sediment (<63 μm) delivered from the Burdekin River is retained within 50 km of the mouth, a finding that contrasts previous studies which postulated that fine sediments are advected northwards via longshore drift processes. The pairing of radiocarbon and OSL ages provides insights on resuspension regimes operating on the inner shelf of the GBR. It was thought that turbidity on inshore GBR coral reefs and seagrass meadows has increased as a result of increased erosion in the adjacent catchment from agricultural development. Our data show that the age of the sediments in Cleveland Bay (derived from the radiocarbon ages from shell and organic material) can be several thousand years older than when the sediment was last deposited (OSL ages). However, the increased turbidity could conceivably be caused from 'new biologically-produced sediment' (i.e. particulate organic matter) as a result of increased nutrient export to the GBR. We suggest that the composition of sediment in resuspension events before and after the wet season be analysed to examine whether newly delivered organic-rich sediment can affect coral reefs and seagrass meadows.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Li:2014tibetan,"Quantifying long-term erosion rates across the Tibetan Plateau and its bordering mountains is of critical importance to an understanding of the interaction between climate, tectonic movement, and landscape evolution. We present a new dataset of basin-wide erosion rates from the central and northern Tibetan Plateau derived using in-situ produced 10Be concentrations of river sediments. Basin-wide erosion rates from the central plateau range from 10.1±0.9 to 36.8±3.2 mm/kyr, slightly higher than published local erosion rates measured from bedrock surfaces. These values indicate that long-term downwearing of plateau surfaces proceeds at low rates and that the landscape is demonstrably stable in the central plateau. In contrast, basin-wide erosion rates from the Kunlun Shan on the northern Tibetan Plateau range from 19.9±1.7 to 163.2±15.9 mm/kyr. Although the erosion rates of many of these basins are much higher than the rates from the central plateau, they are lower than published basin-wide erosion rates from other mountains fringing the Tibetan Plateau, probably because the basins in the Kunlun Shan include both areas of low-relief plateau surface and high-relief mountain catchments and may also result from retarded fluvial sediment transport in an arid climate. Significantly higher basin-wide erosion rates derived from the Tibetan Plateau margin, compared to the central plateau, reflect a relatively stable plateau surface that is being dissected at its margins by active fluvial erosion.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Li:2014tiniroto,"To address potential causes of disturbances in recent New Zealand vegetation a sediment core from Tiniroto Lakes near Gisborne was used to reconstruct the local history of ecological disturbance and vegetation dynamics. Our approach was to examine the pattern and rate of vegetation change, against known disturbances, in order to identify different causes of disturbance. Despite intermittent disturbances, a steady transformation of vegetation dominates the period from c. 4,900 to c. 2,300 cal. yrs B.P. This is a time of climatic amelioration, with increasing precipitation suggested by the decline of light-adapted taxa, together with the establishment of forest. After c. 2,300 cal. yrs B.P., vegetation change becomes much more irregular, and apparently driven by disturbances, including unusual ones, such as earthquakes. In contrast to earlier disturbances, later vegetation responses are typified by a reduction of forest species and the establishment of semi-open vegetation, which persists for decades. This dichotomy suggests that a change in disturbance regime, especially in terms of fire, characterises the period after c. 2,300 cal. yrs B.P. The rises of fire frequency and of intensity at that time could be a result of severe droughts under climate extremes associated with intensified ENSO frequencies.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Lilley:1986thesis,"When Europeans began colonizing coastal western Melanesia in the mid to late nineteenth century, they found a number of trading systems which effectively ringed the island of New Guinea and linked i t with nearby island arcs. The f i r s t anthropologists to study these systems found them to be quite remarkable, in that in the absence of complex socio-political structures they facilitated the movement of large quantities of valuable and utilitarian commodities over often considerable distances and thus served to integrate and distribute resources among the otherwise atomised societies they encompassed. In this thesis I examine archaeological and other evidence bearing on the origins and evolution of the ethnographically famed Siassi trading system, which at the time of European contact spanned the Vitiaz Strait to link northeastern New Guinea with the Bismarck Archipelago. My archaeological investigations concentrate on two sites in the Siassi Islands in the middle of the Vitiaz Strait and one at Sio on the New Guinea mainland. Cultural material recovered from these sites is analysed in order to determine the nature and direction of the developments which led to the emergence of the ethnographically documented form of the Siassi system. Much of the analysis focusses on the nature o f, and changes in , the stylistic and petrological characteristics of excavated pottery. Attention is also paid to aspects of the stone artefact assemblages, particularly variations in the quantities and qualities of obsidian, as well as the shell and bone artefact assemblages and faunal recoveries.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Linari:2016appalachian,"The Blue Ridge escarpment, located within the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, forms a distinct, steep boundary between the lower‐elevation Piedmont and higher‐elevation Blue Ridge physiographic provinces. To understand better the rate at which this landform and the adjacent landscape are changing, we measured cosmogenic beryllium‐10 (10Be) in quartz separated from sediment samples (n  = 50) collected in 32 streams and from three exposed bedrock outcrops along four transects normal to the escarpment, allowing us to calculate erosion rates integrated over 104–105 years. These basin‐averaged erosion rates (5.4–49 m Myr−1) are consistent with those measured elsewhere in the southern Appalachain Mountains and show a positive relationship between erosion rate and average basin slope. Erosion rates show no relationship with basin size or relative position of the Brevard fault zone, a fundamental structural element of the region. The cosmogenic isotopic data, when considered along with the distribution of average basin slopes in each physiographic province, suggest that the escarpment is eroding on average more rapidly than the Blue Ridge uplands, which are eroding more rapidly than the Piedmont lowlands. This difference in erosion rates by geomorphic setting suggests that the elevation difference between the uplands and lowlands adjacent to the escarpment is being reduced but at extremely slow rates.

Lintern:2007barns,"A biogeochemical study was undertaken at Barns Gold Prospect, a Au-in-calcrete discovery in the Northern Eyre Peninsula (South Australia). The prospect is located in highly weathered Proterozoic rocks and is overlain by at least 1 m of aeolian quartz sand that thickens to 8 m as a longitudinal sand dune over part of the mineralization. The dune is well-vegetated, with Melaleuca shrubs and Eucalyptus trees up to 5 m high.Over mineralization anomalous Au concentrations occur in plant organs, litter, soils and sand. The highest Au concentrations (9 ppb) occur in calcareous rhizomorphs high up within the dune. Luminescence dating shows that the dune took no longer than 27 000 years to form and mass balance calculations indicate that the Au anomaly in the dune has formed in less than 10 000 years. Mechanisms for the Au accumulation in the sand are postulated and it appears that a biological process, principally involving vegetation, is the most viable.A 200-m sample spacing of vegetation appears to be adequate for exploration of this type of deposit. Below the sand, calcrete provides a robust sampling medium. At present, due to limited knowledge of exploration methods in this type of environment, the mineral explorer must either expend significant financial resources augering through areas of sand cover to collect buried calcrete samples, or have lower confidence that vegetation and surface soil samples will detect mineralization.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Lintern:2012edoldeh,"Calcrete sampling is the near-surface exploration method of choice for Au in many drier parts of the world, particularly southern Australia. Edoldeh Tank is a weakly mineralised Au prospect in calcrete terrain that lies at the eastern edge of the Great Victoria Desert dunefield (South Australia). At Edoldeh Tank a variety of calcretes occur but the dominant form is a laminated calcrete horizon (LCH). The mineralogy of the near-surface soil is relatively simple and consists of calcite, dolomite, quartz, kaolinite and minor smectite; quartz dominates the unconsolidated overlying sandy soil, and carbonate minerals dominate the LCH. We determine the distribution and nature of the Au at a small scale using a variety of techniques, including SEM, LA-ICP-MS and SXRF and dated sediments to understand calcrete genesis. In a series of thirty excavated soil pits, Ca and Au concentrations increased with depth, markedly so at the LCH. We provide multiple lines of evidence to show there is a general association of Au with calcrete but not a strong correlation as seen with soil profiles elsewhere that have younger, recently formed powdery calcrete. Experiments suggest Au and Ag are currently mobile in this environment despite the low rainfall and that Au occurs in two forms: Au (possibly ionic) occurs throughout the sample with some regions having higher concentrations than others; particulate Au occurs randomly but is more common where the general level of Au is higher. The laminated nature of the calcrete suggests it has formed episodically. An association of Ag with Au in calcrete suggests a means to distinguish anomalies that have developed in residual regolith from those that have dispersed into adjacent sediments. Laminated calcrete is just as effective an exploration sample medium as powdery calcrete. Mobilised Ca, Au and Ag in calcrete can extend the lateral extent and distance from the source of the geochemical anomaly thus providing an effective vector to target for sampling. A landscape dispersion model of Au in calcrete is presented, which requires further testing, to assist the mineral explorer in covered terrains.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Data from one surface midden collection are also presented. In this monsoonal coastal locality, variations in dune stability and sand flux are critical to archaeological site formation and preservation. Site specific factors determining sand sequestration into topsoils interact with geomorphological processes and past human discard to determine the stratigraphy and chronology of individual sites. Taphonomic modes during the Anthropocene have shifted, such that middens are rapidly transformed by wind when exposed in back-beach areas. Processes of sand sequestration present management issues at midden sites, and their chances of survival into the future.

Littleton:2017roonka,"Roonka is one of the most complete excavations of an Aboriginal burial ground in south-eastern Australia. The chronology of the site and the nature of its use have proven difficult to interpret. Previous dating and chronological interpretations of the site have emphasised a chronology of changing use and burial practices, but the nature of the site and the dates obtained do not clearly support these interpretations. We report on the direct dating of human bone from a further ten burials from the main excavation. In order to further investigate the cultural chronology set out by Pretty (1977), samples were selected to cover a range of burial types and preservation states. Comparison of these dates with the previous conventional dates and early AMS dates not only shows the impact of improving technology but demonstrates that multiple burial styles were in use contemporaneously. Moreover, the results suggest that use of the site may have been discontinuous. Consequently, interpretations that assume a chronological sequence for Roonka based on burial practice are not supported, while analyses based on a synchronic interpretation may ignore significant temporal change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Lobb:2015dunphy,"This study addresses a significant geographical and temporal gap that exists in the Holocene record of fire and palaeoenvironmental conditions in the region of the Warrumbungle Mountains in eastern Australia. A multi-proxy approach (sedimentology, geochemistry, geochronology and macro-charcoal) was used at Dunphy Lake. A persistent, deep lake phase between ~18.2-16.8 ka was followed by a transition to infrequent dry and wet phases which continued to the present day. The detailed Late Holocene macro-charcoal record spans the last ~2.2 ka and shows that the main periods of enhanced fire activity coincide with an intensification of El Niño Southern Oscillation. High macro-charcoal concentrations overlap with the deposition of coarse sediment (sand) in Dunphy Lake, suggesting that some fires occurred at similar times to episodes of significant runoff and sediment flux from the catchment associated with intense dry to wet phases. An increase in macro-charcoal during the last ~2.2 ka also coincides with an increase in sediment accumulation rate from a long-term average of 0.0265 cm a-1 to 0.0329 cm a-1. Pollen was only present in the top of the profile, but indicates the occurrence of periodic wet and dry conditions during the last ~0.42 ka. These findings demonstrate a relationship between past fire events and post-fire aggradation, showing that an increase in fire and sedimentation during the Late Holocene is a complex response to environmental change.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Pleistocene glacial phenomena are the most obvious manifestations of climatic change and much of our knowledge on Pleistocene climatic variations in the tropics is based on research into the glacial geomorphology of the high mountains. Other disciplines like palynology have also taken advantage of the high mountains because preservation of plant and pollen material is usually much better in this cold environment than in the tropical lowlands, and these studies have substantially added to the reconstruction of the Pleistocene history of these areas. Access has also been an important factor. Although initially access to the mountains may be difficult, once one has left behind the forested slopes, movement and field observations are much faciliated by lack of forest cover.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Lomax:2003strzelecki,"This study is concerned with the Late Quaternary climatic chronology of the Strzelecki Desert dunefields in central Australia. The sand ridges comprise layers of quartz sand, some of which include palaeosol horizons with carbonated rootlets providing excellent opportunity for dating of alternations of dune building and stability by using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Deduced from the OSL age of the oldest aeolian layer dated, we conclude that the onset of aridity dates back to at least ∼65ka. Older phases of aeolian activity though, following a fluvial depositional phase 160ka ago, cannot be excluded, although no aeolian layers giving evidence for this have been found in the two dunes dated here. Unconsolidated dune sands in the upper part of one section with Late Holocene (4ka to modern) depositional ages indicate a reactivation of the dunefield in recent times. From the crosscheck of 14C ages of the carbonated rootlets with OSL results it is concluded that under the given environmental conditions radiocarbon dating of the calcareous rootlets is not able to provide reliable ages for the phase of soil development.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

So far, one site has been dated using the single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) dose protocol for quartz. A high scatter in individual palaeodoses was observed, which is unexpected in supposedly well bleached aeolian deposits. Therefore other sources of variability such as microdosimetry and bioturbation have to be taken into account.

Lomax:2011murray,"This study is concerned with the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental history of southeastern Australia for the last ∼300 ka by establishing a luminescence chronology of dune sand deposition in the western Murray Basin (South Australia). In the study area, vast fields of palaeodunes, stabilised by vegetation, provide evidence of past environmental change. In total 98 samples were collected from dune sand layers at 13 different dune sections. The time of their deposition was determined using optically stimulated luminescence dating of single quartz grains, accounting for the impact of post-depositional mixing by the use of a finite mixture model. The oldest depositional phase demonstrates that dune sand layers of great antiquity are preserved in the western Murray Basin, ranging up to at least 380 ka. Phases of substantial dune sand deposition were identified for the periods 18–38 ka and 63–72 ka. Older depositional phases also exist, but are poorly resolved due to relatively large errors of the luminescence ages. Aeolian deposition during the last termination and the Holocene is relatively limited, with a slight clustering of ages at the time of the Antarctic Cold Reversal and from 5–8 ka. Two modern ages give evidence of very recent dune sand deposition. Comparison with other palaeoclimate records from the region suggests that phases with high aeolian sedimentation coincide with more arid conditions and breaks in the dune record with more humid phases. Thus, although dune records are often discontinuous and their interpretation in palaeoclimatic terms is not always straightforward, the palaeodunes of the western Murray Basin show a good preservation of phases of aeolian activity and provide useful information for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Long:2014fish,"Fish otoliths from the Willandra Lakes Region World Heritage Area (south-western New South Wales, Australia) have been analysed for oxygen isotopes and trace elements using in situ techniques, and dated by radiocarbon. The study focused on the lunettes of Lake Mungo, an overflow lake that only filled during flooding events and emptied by evaporation, and Lake Mulurulu, which was part of the running Willandra Creek system. Samples were collected from two different contexts: from hearths directly associated with human activity, and isolated surface finds. AMS radiocarbon dating constrains the human activity documented by five different hearths to a time span of less than 240 years around 19,350 cal. BP. These hearths were constructed in aeolian sediments with alternating clay and sand layers, indicative of fluctuating lake levels and occasional drying out. The geochemistry of the otoliths confirms this scenario, with shifts in Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca marking the entry of the fish into Lake Mungo several years before their death, and a subsequent increase in the δ18O by ∼4 indicating increasing evaporation of the lake. During sustained lake-full conditions there are considerably fewer traces of human presence. It seems that the evaporating Lake Mungo attracted people to harvest fish that might have become sluggish through oxygen starvation in an increasingly saline water body (easy prey hypothesis). In contrast, surface finds have a much wider range in radiocarbon age as a result of reworking, and do not necessarily indicate evaporative conditions, as shown by comparison with otoliths from upstream Lake Mulurulu.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Long:2018fish,"The delta18O, Strontium/Calcium and Barium/Calcium values recorded in golden perch otoliths collected from two evaporative lakes, modern Lake Hope and ancient Lake Mungo, have been used to reconstruct changes in water composition and environmental conditions during the life of the fish. Lake Hope was filled by floodwaters in 1989 and 1990, then a period of lake drying was followed by a natural fish death event in 1994. Otoliths from these fish have delta18O profiles reflecting the earlier floods, and the progressive evaporation of the lake. Sr/Ca ratios start to follow the delta18O trend only after evaporation is well advanced, probably after the fish became stressed. Otoliths from a period of early human occupation at Lake Mungo, 14C age range ca. 37-42 cal kBP, record a different history. Most otoliths show a relatively stable delta18O profile throughout the life of each fish, with no evidence of significant lake flooding or drying. Sr/Ca ratios are similarly stable, indicating that over a period of ca. 5 ka evaporation and inflow remained in relative balance. All the otoliths have high Ba/Ca ratios during the early years of the fish, likely a juvenile biological effect in common. The Mungo otoliths differ, in also showing a rise in Ba/Ca ratios in the outermost layers, as yet unexplained. One Mungo otolith, 14C dated at ca. 19.3 cal kBP, does show evaporation and stress trends in delta18O and Sr/Ca ratios respectively, consistent with other evidence that Lake Mungo was subject to frequent drying at that time.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Long:2021anthropocene,"The impacts of human-induced environmental change that characterize the Anthropocene are not felt equally across the globe. In the tropics, the potential for the sudden collapse of ecosystems in response to multiple interacting pressures has been of increasing concern in ecological and conservation research. The tropical ecosystems of Papua New Guinea are areas of diverse rainforest flora and fauna, inhabited by human populations that are equally diverse, both culturally and linguistically. These people and the ecosystems they rely on are being put under increasing pressure from mineral resource extraction, population growth, land clearing, invasive species, and novel pollutants. This study details the last ∼90 y of impacts on ecosystem dynamics in one of the most biologically diverse, yet poorly understood, tropical wetland ecosystems of the region. The lake is listed as a Ramsar wetland of international importance, yet, since initial European contact in the 1930s and the opening of mineral resource extraction facilities in the 1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in deforestation and an influx of people to the area. Using multiproxy paleoenvironmental records from lake sediments, we show how these anthropogenic impacts have transformed Lake Kutubu. The recent collapse of algal communities represents an ecological tipping point that is likely to have ongoing repercussions for this important wetland's ecosystems. We argue that the incorporation of an adequate historical perspective into models for wetland management and conservation is critical in understanding how to mitigate the impacts of ecological catastrophes such as biodiversity loss.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Longmore:1986tyrrell,"The stratigraphy of the upper clay sediments in the northern basin of Lake Tyrrell, a saline playa in northwestern Victoria, is described. The 137Cs activity in sediment profiles was measured at two sites and shows redistribution of the radioisotope to depths well below post-bomb sediments, as indicated by 14C dates and surface pollen spectra. The distribution coefficient (KD) of 137Cs on Lake Tyrrell sediments was measured and found to range from ~3600 at 0 percent NaC1 to -600 at 26 percent NaC1. This low K D for halite-saturated sediments suggests that adsorption sites in the clay lattice are saturated by Na +. An advection--diffusion model with constant input indicates an effective diffusion coefficient of ~1.7 x 10 -8 cm 2 s -~ and a K D of 280, in good agreement with laboratory measurements. More realistic input functions indicate that this is a lower limit on K D. It is concluded that ~37Cs is redistributed in the upper sediments by diffusion due to the low K D resulting from the high salinity. This radioisotope is not useful in locating postbomb sediments in this and probably other highly saline environments.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Longmore:1997perched,"Pollen, carbonised particle and chemical analysis of a 6 m core from the Old Lake Coomboo Depression, a perched lake basin situated in one of the oldest dune systems on Fraser Island, demonstrates vegetation and hydrological change through a series of glacial cycles. The pollen assemblage shifts from predominantly rainforest with Araucaria sp. (Juss.) surrounding a deep water lake at c. 600 ka, to a dryer rainforest with Podocarpus sp. (L’Herit) and an intermediate lake after c. 350 ka, to a more sclerophyllous forest until before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). During the Last Interglacial (c. 120 ka) and before (c. 22 ka) the LGM, Araucaria sp. pollen frequencies increase before falling dramatically, open forest appears to shift to the robust association of myrtaceous shrubs characteristic of the older dune systems to the west of the island, and lake levels fall probably below the lake floor. After the LGM, open forest returns, but Araucaria sp. pollen frequencies never recover and the lake becomes an ephemeral system with a fluctuating water-table in the Holocene. The record is interpreted as reflecting retrogressive vegetation succession driven primarily by an overall decrease in effective precipitation over, at least, the last 350 ka.

Longmore:1999aridity,"A Quaternary sedimentary sequence (ca. 600 ka) from a perched lake (Old Lake Coomboo Depression) on the World Heritage-listed coastal sandmass of Fraser Island has been analysed for dry bulk density, carbonised particles, pollen and chemistry. A chronology has been constructed for the organic sediments using a combination of radiocarbon and uranium/thorium disequilibrium analysis. The lake basin is small (ca. 9 ha) with a restricted groundwater catchment, delimited by an aquitard, and minimal surface runoff. It therefore acts as a sensitive raingauge with the perched groundwater-table, and hence the sediment facies deposited within the lake, reacting sensitively to any changes in the water budget. The sequence passes through a series of glacial cycles, demonstrating hydrologic and vegetation change. The record indicates a long-term, three-stage fall in the water-table from lake-full ca. 600 ka to an ephemeral lake in the Holocene, paralleled by a shift in the vegetation composition from predominantly rainforest to sclerophyllous components. The evidence for fire is minimal at the beginning of the record, increases from >350 ka through the sequence culminating at or before the LGM, is low during the LGM and is relatively high during the Holocene. Succession, fire and climatic change, along with the accumulative effect of a series of 100 ka cycles, are believed to have driven the hydrologic and vegetation change and a human factor is not required to explain the record. Within the overall long-term increase in aridity recorded through about six glacial cycles, there appears to be a variation in the ‘dryness’ signal of glacial maxima, suggesting some form of ‘supercycle’ phenomenon.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

The Pleistocene engraving period predates the sea-level rise and the midden phase of occupation on the peninsula. These sites are interpreted as possible men-only, turtle increase sites. An intensive period of engraving is placed at between 7,000 and 2,000 years BP, coinciding with the period of intensive shellfish gathering. A range of domestic activities probably took place at these engraving sites at this time. A period postdating the intensive midden period is correlated with a phase of more sporadic shellfish gathering, when settlement patterns were more dispersed.

In this article, we present a series of dates that provide, for the first time, some definitive insights into this question. We clearly show that this burial tradition is one of considerable antiquity that absolutely predates both the contact and settlement periods not only within the region but for Australia as a whole.

Low:2015hunter,"Backed artefacts formed a significant component of hunter–gatherer stone tool–kits dating to the mid– to late Holocene in Australia. A popular model explaining this pattern views backed artefacts as standardised components of reliable and maintainable composite tools designed to reduce risk associated with foraging in a drier, more variable climate. Implied is the idea that there is a minimal range of variation in form. The degree to which backed artefacts were standardised, however, remains unclear. Re–analysis of backed artefacts from Sandy Hollow and Bobadeen in the Hunter River valley, excavated in the 1960s, was undertaken to assess standardisation in the metrical attributes of backed forms. Results highlight the standardisation of backed artefacts, though the degree to which different dimensions appear uniform varies between the two assemblages.

Overall, the results of this analysis provide support in favour of the model which views backed artefacts as standardised tool components.

This study explores geomorphological and geoarchaeological approaches for understanding a sandstone rockshelter in interior northern Australia: Gledswood Shelter 1. At this site, magnetic susceptibility and micromorphology techniques were integrated with bulk sedimentology, soil chemistry and geochronology to better understand the record of human impact and site formation processes. The micromorphology studies indicate that primary depositional fabrics, such as graded bedding or laminations, are absent, and sediment structural development is low throughout the entire sequence, with most samples exhibiting a high degree of post-depositional mixing. The sediment magnetic susceptibility analysis reveals magnetic changes coinciding with human occupation, a result of anthropogenic burning. Specifically we highlight that combustion features are prevalent in this sandstone shelter and provide critical insights into the human usage of the shelter.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Luebbers:1978meals,"Current research into the causes of prehistoric coastal adaptation in southern Australia has emphasized the influence of the marine environment without considering other environmental or cultural factors which may also direct economic growth. The research described here considers the case of prehistoric settlement in swamps and coastal margins in South Australia in an effort to explain shifts in subsistence strategies in terms of the process of adaptation. The 19th century ecology of the area is first reconstructed with reference to primary resources available in the sea, lagoon, and swamps. Against this information, the local ethnography is used to propose broad subsistence strategies by which the annual food quest may have operated during the late prehistoric occupation. The archaeological implications are considered in light of this information. The archaeological record of settlement spans the last 10,000 years and can be divided into two cultural horizons. The first is an Early Holocene occupation which is distributed widely in association with swampside exploitation. The second horizon begins at 6000BP and can be divided into two primary occupation phases. The Early Phase (6000-1300BP) is represented in discrete monospecific middens of either Plebidonax or the mussel Brachidontes located mostly on hinddune surfaces. Both molluscs are locally extinct. The Late Phase by contrast is characterized by large deposits of several extant reef gastropods at a variety of localities throughout the coastal margin. Furthermore, a microlithic component flourishes during the Early Phase of occupation, but is absent later. This evidence indicates significant changes in occupation intensity and subsistence technologies which cannot be linked to Mid-Holocene sea level adjustments. Other explanations are therefore considered. To resolve this problem, estimates are made of the size and organization of primary shellfishing groups operating in each of the two occupation phases. Growth rings of Plebidonax in single meals are examined to 1) determine contemporaneity of collection events represented by individual refuse heaps occurring in clusters, and 2) to estimate the pattern of seasonal occupation. ...

Luly:1990thesis,"This thesis presents a pollen analytical reconstruction of mallee vegetation history in the vicinity of Lake Tyrrell, a large active salt lake in semi-arid northwestern Victoria. The project combined studies of the modern pollen rain, pollen depositional processes and sedimentological characteristics of lake deposits to provide an analytical framework appropriate to the interpretation of fossil pollen spectra from the novel salt lake setting. Pollen trapping in northwestern Victoria and western New South Wales indicates that the characteristic plant communities of semi-arid southeastern Australia can be identified from the pollen spectra they produce. Mallee heath communities produce spectra containing a diverse array of heathland taxa with limited pollen dispersal capacities, including Banksia, Baeckea behrii, Cryptandra and Calytrix tetragona. Mallee heaths also produce large amounts of Calli tris pollen but can be distinguished from Callitris woodland by the regular presence of pollen from restricted heathland taxa. Pollen spectra from chenopod shrublands are characterised by overwhelming dominance by Chenopodiaceae pollen. Other halophytic taxa often represented include Selenothamnus and Disphyma. Riverine forests produce pollen spectra dominated by Eucalyptus Muehlenbeckia cunninghamii and Amyema pollen occur commonly. It may be possible to identify pollen of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in fossil assemblages allowing this community to be more clearly delineated in the fossil record. Mallee communities can be distinguished from eucalypt dominated communities in moister areas by producing pollen spectra containing relatively high percentages of chenopod pollen and low percentages of grass pollen. Eucalypt woodlands in areas receiving more than 400 mm mean annual rainfall produce pollen spectra containing appreciable quantities of Callitris pollen. No relationship could be discerned between pollen production and rainfall in this study. Pollen trapping at Lake Tyrrell suggests that the majority of pollen arriving at the lake surface is wind borne. Few are washed from the lake margin or imported down Tyrrell Creek. This contrasts strongly with the situation in humid areas where pollen washed from the catchment or carried in creeks are a significant part of a lakes pollen budget. Pollen reaching the surface of Lake Tyrrell are rapidly redistributed and are preferentially deposited in areas marginal to the persistent salt crust. Maximum pollen concentrations occur on relatively high parts of the lake bed, again contrasting strongly with models derived from permanently wet lakes where maximum deposition of pollen occurs in the deepest parts of the basin. The sediments of Lake Tyrrell record a history of hydrological change extending to approximately 10,000 BP. Between 10,000 BP and 6600 BP water in Lake Tyrrell was shallow, saline and probably ephemeral. Water depths and the frequency I duration of flooding were most likely similar to those experienced today but there was no persistent salt crust. Between 6600 BP and 2200 BP the lake was a permanent though fluctuating waterbody. The lake waters were saline throughout this period. Water balance calculations suggest average rainfall in the lake catchment would have been approximately 2.6 times modern levels between 6600 BP and 2200 BP. The lake was dry between 2200 BP and 800 BP. The local groundwater table fell below the lake bed. There was no salt crust until about 800 BP when rainfall increased slightly allowing local watertables to rise and modem salt lake conditions to develop. Changes in vegetation around Lake Tyrrell occur in association with changes in rainfall. Between 10,000 BP and 6600 BP Lake Tyrrell was surrounded by open woodland dominated by Allocasuarina Eucalyptus and Callitris were probably present in limited areas. At 6600 BP mallee communities began to dominate the landscape. It is likely the appearance of mallee reflects the arrival of mallee eucalypts spreading from refugial areas occupied during the last glacial maximum. Callitris patches were a prominent element of the regional vegetation during this the wettest interval in the Holocene record. They appear little affected by the active fire regime of the times. Between 2200 BP and 800 BP mallee persisted and Allocasuarina experienced a modest expansion. Callitris declined drastically. The dense mallee vegetation which surrounded the lake at the time of European settlment was established after 800 BP. The history of Holocene environmental change identified from Lake Tyrrell provides a possible explanation for the patterns of archaeological site distribution observed in the Mallee Districts of northwestern Victoria.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

A marked increase in rainfall at about 6600 BP trans­formed the lake from an ephemeral to a permanent water body.

Luly:2001callitris,"Fossil pollen assemblages suggest Callitris (Cupressaceae)-dominated woodlands were prominent elements in landscapes near Lake Frome and Lake Eyre during latest Pleistocene times. Callitris woodlands were present at Lake Eyre before 30,000 BP but became fragmented and disappeared in the lead up to the last glacial maximum. Callitris was again prominent from approximately 10,000 BP until about 5000 BP after which time it vanishes from the pollen record and, presumably, the region. At Lake Frome, Callitris was abundant between 16,000 BP and 13,000 BP before declining to low modern levels from 11,000 BP. At both sites, the latest Pleistocene or Holocene decline in Callitris occurrence, and its eventual extinction in the vicinity of Lake Eyre, broadly corresponds with archaeological indications of increasing human presence in the landscape. In the absence of evidence of significant climatic changes at the times in question, these observations lend tentative support to arguments that the composition and structure of modern zone vegetation has been significantly modified by Aboriginal land management practices.

Luly:2006threequarter,"Pollen and diatom analyses of organic sediments from Three-Quarter Mile Lake, a perched lake on Cape York Peninsula, north Queensland, indicate that significant changes in vegetation and hydrology occurred during the Holocene. Early Holocene grass-dominated landscapes were replaced in mid-Holocene times by increasingly woody vegetation comprising tropical heathlands, savanna and rainforest. Early-Holocene lake levels fluctuated widely. From mid-Holocene times, lake levels stabilized and water became increasingly acidic as a mature swamp forest developed adjacent to the lake and contributed tannins to the lake water. The timing and character of changes are consistent with those described from the Atherton Tableland in wet tropical Queensland. Holocene dry phases described from the Northern Territory and the western shores of Cape York cannot be identified from Three-Quarter Mile Lake. Rainforest is currently close to its greatest Holocene extent, suggesting that the rainforest-dependent endemic fauna of northern Cape York have been isolated from rainforest blocks to the south throughout the last 10 000 years and, by inference, throughout at least the 120 000 years beyond that.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

River sand was sampled over several years in the main trans-Himalayan rivers, from the Himalayan front to the Ganga outlet in Bangladesh. The calculated 10Be denudation rates of the trans-Himalayan river basins range from 0.5 to 2.4 mm yr−1 (average 1.3 mm yr−1) and vary by up to a factor of 3 between sampling years.

Lupker:2017syntaxis,"The Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River drains the eastern part of the Himalayan range and flows from the Tibetan Plateau through the eastern Himalayan syntaxis downstream to the Indo-Gangetic floodplain and the Bay of Bengal. As such, it is a unique natural laboratory to study how denudation and sediment production processes are transferred to river detrital signals. In this study, we present a new 10Be data set to constrain denudation rates across the catchment and to quantify the impact of rapid erosion within the syntaxis region on cosmogenic nuclide budgets and signals. The measured 10Be denudation rates span around 2 orders of magnitude across individual catchments (ranging from 0.03 to > 4 mm yr−1) and sharply increase as the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra flows across the eastern Himalaya. The increase in denudation rates, however, occurs  ∼  150 km downstream of the Namche Barwa–Gyala Peri massif (NBGPm), an area which has been previously characterized by extremely high erosion and exhumation rates. We suggest that this downstream lag is mainly due to the physical abrasion of coarse-grained, low 10Be concentration, landslide material produced within the syntaxis that dilutes the upstream high-concentration 10Be flux from the Tibetan Plateau only after abrasion has transferred sediment to the studied sand fraction. ...

Objectives Here, we describe research to inform ecosystem restoration and conservation of Chumbrumba Swamp within the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, Australia. Many such open wetlands in the region have been degraded through agriculture and pastoral production, but there has been little research into their status, history and conservation needs. Methods The recent to pre-European settlement history of the site was explored, along with spatial variation of vegetation communities at the site, and these data integrated with historical and ethnographical information on the site and its cultural values. Results The botanical and palaeoecological analyses showed that Chumbrumba Swamp comprises a unique and highly sensitive ecosystem mosaic with high biodiversity. An endangered ecosystem complex, 82 vascular plant species, several disjunct or endemic taxa, and species at new northern range limits were recorded within its 20 ha area. The site comprises a stable swamp site with fringing woodland and rainforest that has persisted for around 5000 years. European settlement overlaid changes in the vegetation from disturbance (e.g. fire, clearing, grazing). However, fire also affected the swamp site during pre-European times.

Machida:1996eruptions,"Witori and Dakataua caldera volcanoes have been very active in the middle to late Holocene. Using tephrochronology, this paper establishes the chronostratigraphy of these eruptions and their magnitude, and the frequency of explosive volcanism at Witori and Dakataua. After a long dormancy, Witori started explosive activity at ca. 5600 conventional radiocarbon years BP, producing in the next 4500 years five major tephra layers (W-K1 to W-K4, W-G) with VEIs of 5 to 6. After the W-G eruption at around 1200 BP, the activity decreased in magnitude but increased in frequency, with some eruptions forming central cones. The major eruption of Dakataua began with alternating ejections of phreatomagmatic ashfalls and plinian deposits followed by the cataclysmic eruption resulting in lithic-rich pyroclastic flows ca. 1100–1200 BP. The major tephra layers cover extensive areas in West New Britain due to their large volumes and the prevailing easterly winds, providing valuable time markers for establishing Holocene chronology. The largest eruption, the W-K2 event of ca. 3300 BP, shaped much of the present landscape, with an extensive area significantly devastated by tephra falls and pyroclastic flows. Obsidian and other artefacts buried by the tephras indicate that the area was repeatedly occupied.

Macken:2011naracoorte,"Cave deposits of infill sediments and associated vertebrate fossils provide a valuable source of information on terrestrial palaeoenvironments, climatic conditions and palaeocommunities. In the deposits of the Naracoorte Caves World Heritage Area, such records span the last 500 ka and are renowned for their rich, diverse vertebrate assemblages. Previous research into the Grant Hall deposit of Victoria Fossil Cave suggested that it may preserve the only peak last interglacial (ca. 125 ka) faunal community within the World Heritage Area. The current work tested this existing model for the age of faunal remains from Grant Hall using multiple techniques. Physical and geochemical properties of the visually homogeneous sediments were analysed at regular intervals through the sequence to establish meaningful stratigraphic divisions and sediment provenance. Optically stimulated luminescence dating of individual quartz grains indicates that sediments accumulated in Grant Hall from 93~±~8 to 70~±~5 ka. Minimum ages provided by U/Th dating of fossil teeth (72.3~±~2.2 to 38.2~±~0.8 ka) are consistent with the luminescence chronology, and show that the deposit represents a more recent faunal accumulation than previously modelled for the site. U/Th ages on calcite straws within the deposit are significantly older than the sediments and fossil teeth (>500 to 186.4~±~1~ka). As such they provide no further constraint on the chronology of the deposit but do indicate that speleothem deposition was active over much of the Middle Pleistocene. Sedimentary analyses resulted in the identification of five depositional units, contrasting with previous divisions which were based only on visual observation of the sedimentary sequence. Sediments within each unit are broadly classified as sandy silts with soil structures and may be indirectly derived from the lunettes of nearby Bool Lagoon, although their ultimate provenance is unknown. As a result of this work, palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on fossil remains in the deposit may be more accurately related to prevailing climatic and environmental conditions at the time of accumulation. It also contributes to an understanding of the temporal occurrence of regional vertebrate faunas through the Late Pleistocene, reinforcing the value of developing stratigraphically constrained chronologies for cave deposits based on multiple techniques.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Macken:2012variation,"We examined mammal occurrence and variability through the Late Pleistocene vertebrate fossil deposit of Grant Hall in Victoria Fossil Cave, Naracoorte, South Australia. To determine long-term patterns of change, we compared the composition and relative abundance trends of the assemblage with a nearby Middle Pleistocene deposit in Cathedral Cave. Total species richness did not change through the Grant Hall sequence, dated from 93  8 to 70  5 ka. However, species relative abundances varied between ecologically divergent species, and in some cases between species that demonstrate similar environmental preferences. For some species this variation is comparable to that recorded in Cathedral Cave. Of those showing similar trends between the two deposits, the forest inhabitant, Pseudomys fumeus, recorded an 8.6% decline through Grant Hall, coincident with a 9.7% increase in the dry heath/mallee dweller Pseudomys apodemoides. These patterns indicate that climatic transition from relatively warm, moist to cooler, drier conditions impacted some species in similar ways through climatic cycles of the past. However, the majority of the fauna demonstrated complex responses that are individual and variable through time. Statistical tests of species trends from the Grant Hall assemblage caution that large fossil samples are required to validate patterns observed.

By comparing key regional studies to the findings from Hazards Lagoon broad scale change in vegetation composition are identified, which are likely to be responding to periods of climatic and sea level change in the Southern Hemisphere. Pollen and charcoal analysis identify a steepe community being established on the east coast of Tasmania during the height of the Last Glacial Maximum developing into an open Eucalypt forest 17,000 yrs BP in response to regional climatic amelioration. The Hazards Lagoon record suggests a significant change in the catchment morphology from a permanent lake surrounded by steepe and woodland during the Last Glacial Maximum to the development of a peat swamp and the local establishment of a sclerophyll forest during the last termination. During the Holocene extant vegetation composition and local fire regimes at Hazards Lagoon have responded to rising sea levels, the onset of modern climates and human occupation. The palynological record from Hazards Lagoon provides the oldest study of the late Quaternary for the east cost of Tasmania and has been compared to key sites within Tasmania and south-eastern mainland Australia identifying temperature and precipitation as the climatic constraints on the development of vegetation since the last glacial maximum.

Elemental data and grain size analyses are combined with lead-210 (210Pb) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) carbon-14 (14C) dates. An open coastal environment was present 1250 cal. a BP on the south east coast of Bentinck Island, with sediment supply incorporating fluvial deposition and detrital input of titanium and iron from eroding lateritic bedrock.

Wetlands developed at sites on the north and west coasts ~500 and ~450 cal. a BP, respectively. Geochemical and grain size analyses indicate that wetlands formed as accreting tidal mudflats or within inter-dune swales that intercepted groundwater draining to the coastal margins.

Mackenzie:2016thesis,"A wealth of palaeoecological studies from the Australasian region identify periods of significant environmental change during the Holocene. However, relatively few studies have focused on the coastal lowlands of tropical northern Australia, limiting our ability to accurately reconstruct this vast bioregion's history. This study addresses the gap in spatially distributed paleoenvironmental research in northern Australia by producing the first reconstructions from the South Wellesley Islands in the Southern Gulf of Carpentaria. Radioisotope analysis of lead (210Pb), plutonium (239/240Pu) and radiocarbon (14C) provide robust geochronologies. Chronologies are combined with loss on ignition, particle size and micro X-ray fluorescence analyses to identify site formation and development through time. Pollen and macroscopic and microscopic charcoal records were used to examine vegetation change and fire regimes throughout the late Holocene. This research shows coastal wetlands developed during the late Holocene in the South Wellesley Islands. Combined multi-proxy results indicate environmental change initially drove vegetation succession, but that human occupation and abandonment of the islands significantly affected vegetation composition and fire regimes. Radioisotope and geochemical analyses were conducted in collaboration with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation. 210Pb alpha spectrometry analysis of 18 samples provide sedimentation rates and a chronology of the last 150 years across three key sites. This period is significant as traditional owners were removed in 1948, leaving the South Wellesley Islands unoccupied for the first time in 2,000 years. This research attempted to calibrate 210Pb results using the anthropogenic radioisotope plutonium by analysing 10 samples using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Results of 239/240Pu isotope analysis found the site's stratigraphy was insufficiently laminated to accurately pick peaks in fallout. However, levels of 239/240Pu indicate fallout occurred across far northern Australia and the technique has the potential to validate 210Pb results in appropriate sedimentary settings. Geochronologies combined 210Pb dates and bulk sediment 14C AMS dates. This research examined seven sediment profiles using micro X-ray fluorescence geochemical data and particle size analysis. 210Pb and 14C dates provide age-depth chronologies, identifying local and island-wide trends. Elemental analysis of coastal wetlands through time identified key phases of development including open coastal environments, mangrove establishment, hypersaline mudflat expansion and brackish/freshwater wetland development. An open coastal environment was present 1,250 cal. yr BP on the southeast coast of Bentinck Island, with fluvial deposition of detrital elements from the eroding lateritic bedrock. A prograding shoreline, dune development and tributary diversion created a series of swales parallel to the coast by 800 cal. yr BP, forming the extensive Marralda Wetlands. Saline mudflats developed at sites on the north and west coast at 500 and 450 cal. yr BP, respectively... [_truncated_]",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mackenzie:2017hazards,"A late Quaternary pollen and charcoal record from Hazards Lagoon on the east coast of Tasmania provides a continuous record of vegetation and climate change. The pollen record shows an Epacridaceae and Poaceae dominated grassland community replaced dry sclerophyll forest during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM ~22e18 cal ka BP). Eucalyptus and Casuarinaceae increased from the beginning of the deglacial period (~18-12 cal ka BP) indicating early warming on the east coast of Tasmania. Abundant Myriophyllum and sedimentary characteristics indicate Hazards Lagoon was a permanent source of water throughout the LGM and until 16 cal ka BP suggesting either increased precipitation and/or decreased evaporation rates. A positive moisture balance throughout the LGM contrasts with records from the west coast of Tasmania and parts of mainland Australia. Fire was suppressed at the site until 14 cal ka BP, corresponding with reduced woody vegetation and a positive moisture balance. Dry sclerophyll forest established during the deglacial period, remaining stable throughout the Holocene. A coastal vegetation community developed in response to sea-level rise, characterised by abundant Eucalyptus pollen and increasing values of Casuarinaceae. By the mid-Holocene, the Hazards Lagoon pollen record is typical of a Tasmanian coastal site dominated by Casuarinaceae.

Mackenzie:2020wetland,"This study presents three records of environmental change during the late-Holocene from wetlands across Bentinck Island in the South Wellesley Islands, northern Australia. Radiometric dating provided ages for sediment cores with the longest chronology spanning the last 1250 cal. yr BP. Palynological results show the diverse mangrove community transitioned to woodland- and wetland-dominated vegetation over the last 850 years on the southeast coast. The key driver of this landscape change was likely late-Holocene sea level regression and coastal progradation in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This study found freshwater wetlands expanded across Bentick Island over the last 500 years, with sedges and rushes peaking in the last 350 years. Macroscopic and microscopic charcoal records, coupled with archaeological evidence, highlights the spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes across the island, reflecting the traditional fire management practices of the Kaiadilt people during the late-Holocene. This study finds a significant increase in charcoal accumulation in the 1900s when Kaiadilt fire practices were disrupted and the South Wellesley Islands were abandoned.

Seven pollen sequences, each continuous and extending back at least 10,000 years, are used to reconstruct the history of postglacial vegetation and climate in Southern Tasmania (42°S–43°30′S). Interpretations are supported by a study of the modern pollen rain. Postglacial climates in Tasmania were characterized by a strong west-to-east decrease in precipitation. During the late Pleistocene, climates were markedly colder and drier than at present, and the vegetation was largely devoid of trees. A major rise in temperature between ca. 11,500 and 9500 yr B.P., accompanied by rising effective precipitation, resulted in the expansion of Eucalyptus, then other trees, across Tasmania.

Macphail:1984sclerophyll,"Pollen analysis of organic sediments in a small hollow at Tarraleah in central Southern Tasmania allows identification of some small-scale patterns and processes within Eucalyptus wet sclerophyll forest during the early to middle Holocene. These events are related to a time scale of inferred ages (i.a.), based on three radiocarbon dates and stratigraphic constraints. Although relatively few tree and tall shrub taxa are involved, changes in relative abundance show that at least five floristically distinctive communities of understorey mesophytes have surrounded the hollow. Prior to i.a, 9125 B.P., subalpine Eucalyptus open forest or woodland formed the local vegetation: 1. Pomaderris apetala-- Compositae i.a. 8900 to 8325 B.P. 2. Atherosperma moschatum -- Dicksonia antarctica i.a. 8175 to 7775 b.p. 3. Phyllocladus aspleniifolius -- (?)Nothofagus cunninghamii i.a. 7625 to 7350 b.p. 4. Pomaderris apetala-- sclerophyll shrubs i.a. 7200 to 6925 b.p. 5. Dicksonia antarctica after i.a. 6925 b.p. In most general terms the forest and mire species have behaved consistently with their modern ecological preferences and established trends in Holocene climate. With more detailed resolution, the influence of climate is less apparent and the shifts in community composition more likely to be due to fire frequency and edaphic effects. The results confirm the modern observation that canopy eucalypts and understorey species are only weakly correlated in the presence of fire. Fire has resulted in the separation of Pomaderris apetala communities into two ecological entities but in the absence of fire - and fire-promoting climates - during the early Holocene, P. apetala and associated mesophytic small trees may have been able to exclude competitively the canopy eucalypts. Similarly the data indicate early Holocene rainforests may have been enriched with A. moschatum. The marked increase in fire frequency at or after i.a. 6925 b.p. is suggested to be due to migration into or increased utilization of the area by Aborigines.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Macphail:1999peat,"Small mounds of peat rise several metres above the level of the water‐table at Melaleuca Inlet and Louisa Plains on the buttongrass plains in southwest Tasmania. Possible origins of the peat mounds have been explored by pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of a set of samples taken from a vertical section of one peat mound at Melaleuca. The peat accumulation is entirely of Holocene age although the mound is underlain by sapric peats preserving a cold climate palynoflora of probable Late Pleistocene age. Peats at and near the base of the mound accumulated under a heath sedgeland during the earliest Holocene while after about 7630 a BP the peat‐forming vegetation was shrub‐dominated. The radiocarbon data indicate two main phases of overall peat accumulation, between 7630 and 5340 a BP (Middle Holocene) and between 4450 and 450 a BP (Late Holocene), that were interrupted by a wildfire which burnt into the surface peats. The maintenance of high surface and internal levels of moisture almost certainly was the critical factor behind the low incidence of in situ fires burning into the surface peats on the mound. The perennial influx of groundwater below the mound is a possible origin that fits well with our observations, although the expansion and contraction of soils cannot be discounted as an initiating factor. Enhanced nutrient input from birds may have helped promote growth in the peat‐forming communities. The data do not support the mounds being eroded remnants of a former blanket peat cover or being due to periglacial activity. The peat mounds of southwest Tasmania deserve maximum protection because of their rarity in the Australian landscape and, it seems, elsewhere.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

Although sediments contemporary with Polynesian occupation about 800 years ago were destroyed by European draining and cultivation of the swamp during the early nineteenth century, the pollen data indicate that New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) was introduced to Norfolk Island by Polynesians. Other putative exotics such as Ti (Cordyline), a bull-rush (Typha orientalis) and, less certain, herbs such as the sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus), were part of the native flora long before the earliest recorded Polynesian settlement.

Magee:1995madigan,"Madigan Gulf is a large bay at the southern end of Lake Eyre North, a major ephemerally flooded playa in arid central Australia at the southwestern margin of a vast (1,300,000 km2) internal drainage basin. The stratigraphy and chronology of the Quaternary sequence in the gulf is described from 8 cores and a cliff exposure at the gulf margin. A number of depositional environments are recognised and their distinctive sedimentary components are described. Facies recognised include deep- and shallow-water lacustrine environments, dominated by surface-water processes, and dry or ephemerally flooded playa environments dominated by groundwater-controlled processes. Sedimentary components include terrigenous clastics from river inflow and shoreline erosion, carbonates of detrital, inorganic or biological origin and gypsum and halite evaporites. Carbonates and gypsum evaporites, precipitated within the basin, are frequently reworked as clastic components. The establishment of a preliminary chronology for the sequence, by the application of thermoluminescence, uranium/thorium disequilibrium, amino acid racemization and radiocarbon dating techniques, has allowed a reconstruction of the last 130 ka of Lake Eyre palaeohydrology. The wettest phase occurred during the last interglacial (early in oxygen isotope stage 5) when an enlarged Lake Eyre was up to 25 m deep. Subsequently there has been a number of dry periods separating successively less effective wet phases culminating in the deposition of a substantial halite salt crust around the time of the glacial maximum. The dry interludes are characterised by deflation of salts and sediment from the basin, a process controlled by lowering of the watertable. The record from Madigan Gulf demonstrates the dramatic and repetitive impact of lake deflation on the Quaternary record of Lake Eyre. In the early Holocene a minor, but mostly perennial, lacustrine event was terminated at about 3-4 ka when the modern ephemeral playa regime was established. The major catchment of Lake Eyre is located in the monsoon-watered areas of northern Australia. As demonstrated by large floodings of the modern ephemeral regime, major lacustrine episodes must indicate enhanced monsoon precipitation in northern Australia. In the Holocene the lake has not risen to levels achieved during the early stage 5 lacustral phase, indicating a marked reduction in the effectiveness of the monsoon in the present interglacial by comparison with its predecessor.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Magee:1997eyre,"This study has examined the Quaternary record of lacustrine, fluvial and aeolian sediments from the Lake Eyre region to determine the palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrologic history of the basin, particularly over the past 130 ka (130,000 years). Detailed observations of the sedimentology, stratigraphy and geomorphology of the deposits are presented. These are organised on a regional basis and are used to infer the palaeoenvironmental history of the pronounced hydrologic response in Lake Eyre to climatic changes over the past 130 ka. Through much of the Quaternary, the lake's depocentre has migrated towards the south and south-west. This process has been chiefly driven by groundwatercontrolled deflation processes and the asymmetry of sediment supply. This is related to the location of the major inflowing streams on the downwind, northern and north-eastern margins of the lake. These groundwater-controlled processes have excavated the modern Lake Eyre playa basin into sediments which were deposited during previous surface-water lacustrine episodes. The lake has at times been a vast perennial waterbody, with an area larger than the combination of the present Lake Eyre South and Lake Eyre North(> 10,000 km2) and a water depth of up to 25m above the present playa floor. ...

Magee:1998eyre,"Lake Eyre is presently an ephemeral playa-lake in an extremely large (1.3 million km2 internal drainage basin), with most of its inflow derived from monsoon-watered northern Australia. The hydrologic state of the lake has varied in the past, in response to climate change, from a perennial lake up to 25 metres deep to a groundwater-controlled playa, marked by substantial sediment deflation. This paper is concerned with the stratigraphic record of the last 60 ka of that hydrologic history, particularly the character and age of a playa-marginal unit formed by deflation from the playa and of stranded high beach ridges. A major deflation episode between 60 and 50 ka excavated the present Lake Eyre basin and deposited a gypsum- and clay-rich aeolian phase (the Williams Point aeolian unit) at a number of sites around the lake. After deflation ceased a thick secondary gypsum profile developed on the dune early in oxygen-isotope stage 3; evidence for the state of Lake Eyre at this time is equivocal. Preliminary results from a substantial suite of amino acid racemization (AAR) analyses of mollusc shell and bird eggshell samples from beach ridges at +5 and +10 m Australian Height Datum (AHD) suggest that they are oxygen-isotope stage 5 in age. Sedimentologic evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the shells are reworked from older deposits. These AAR results apparently conflict with early oxygen-isotope stage 3 thermoluminescence (TL) dates from the +5 m AHD beach ridge (Nanson et al., this volume). However, the age difference is not substantial, the calibration of the AAR is still at a preliminary stage and only one site was sampled for both techniques. Further stratigraphic and chronologic work is required to fully assess the apparent discrepancy. Between about 30,000 and 12,000 yr B.P. Lake Eyre was at least as dry as it is today. At many sites around Madigan Gulf a lunette-like, playa-marginal, aeolian unit (the Shelly Island unit) was deposited during this period, formed by material deflated from the playa floor. Forty AMS radiocarbon dates span the period 35,000 to 10,000 yr B.P., from the Shelly Island unit (11) and from aeolian sediment close to playa level (29), indicating that the lake was dry during this period. This evidence conflicts strongly with 2 TL dates from latest oxygen-isotope stage 3 and oxygen-isotope stage 2 from the +5 and +10 m AHD beach ridges (Nanson et al., this volume). Additionally, the AAR results from the high beach ridges cannot be reconciled with these TL dates. After 10,000 yr B.P. a minor lacustral phase occurred until the modern ephemeral playa regime became established at 3000-4000 yr B.P.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Magee:2004monsoon,"Our reconstructed history of Lake Eyre provides the first continuous continental proxy record of Australian monsoon intensity over the past 150 k.y. This continental record's broad correspondence to the marine isotope record demonstrates that this very large catchment, with its hydrology dependent on a planetary-scale climate element, responds to Milankovitch-scale climate forcing. Abrupt transitions from dry phases to wet phases (ca. 125 and 12 ka) coincide with Northern Hemisphere winter insolation minima rather than Southern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, indicating that Northern Hemisphere insolation exerts a dominant control over the intensity of the Australian monsoon. Stratigraphic and dating uncertainties of other wet phases preclude conclusive correlation to specific insolation signals but, within the uncertainties, are consistent with Northern Hemisphere forcing. Regardless of the hemispheric forcing, the low intensity of the early Holocene Australian monsoon--by comparison with the last interglacial and particularly the last high-level lacustrine event at 65-60 ka when all forcing elements were modest-- is an enigma that can be explained by a change in boundary conditions within Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In southern Peninsular India, the impressive topographic relief of the Western Ghat Mountains in tectonic quiescence since at least ca. 65 Ma has raised important questions concerning the long-term mechanism of topographic evolution. Quantifying the distribution of erosion in space and time is critical to understanding landscape evolution. Although the long-term erosion rates are reasonably well known, the short-term erosion rates and the relative importance of factors controlling erosion in southern Peninsular India are less well constrained. We present a new suite of catchment-averaged and local erosion rates using in situ produced 10Be concentrations in river sediments and exposed bedrock samples in southern Peninsular India.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Mandal:2021cyclicity,"The evolution of Earth‘s climate over geological timescales is linked to surface erosion via weathering of silicate minerals and burial of organic carbon. However, methodological difficulties in reconstructing erosion rates through time and feedbacks among tectonics, climate, and erosion spurred an ongoing debate on mountain erosion sensitivity to tectonic and climate forcing. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether late Cenozoic climate cooling has increased global erosion rates or not. The Himalaya plays a prominent role in this debate as its erosion produces a large fraction of global sediments delivered to ocean basins. We report a 6-Myr-long record of 10Be-derived erosion rates from the north-western Himalaya, which indicates that erosion rates in this region varied quasi-cyclically with a period of ∼1 Myr and increased gradually toward the present. ...

Mangi:1984manim,"The analysis and subsequent interpretation of any archaeological material is heavily dependent upon the observations and recordings compiled in the field; basically in the form of field notes and photographs. Apart from these sources, there are also those observations and experiences that never find their way into the notes but nonetheless play a vital role in the interpretation of the material. In the words of J. B. Watson (1977; viii) ‘Whatever the replicable truth of a library or laboratory, in field-based research, when the data are gathered and stored and still await description and analysis, a change of researchers is a serious chnge. The best one can hope for is patience, imagination and courage of the second worker.‘ The death of Ole Christensen was a great loss to his profession and to his colleagues at the Australian National University fell the responsibility of ensuring that the important work of this young scholar was brought to completion. (Golson, in ‘Foreword‘ to Chrsitensen 1975; 25). It is indeed a sad state of affairs because in a bid to complete this work many scholars have looked at specific aspects of a material collection that was intended to be anaysed as a whole. In 1977 Dr. Phil Huges went back to the site and du up part of the backfilled excavation to look at the processes of the sedimentology. K. Aplin (1981) analysed hte faunal remains from some of the sites and J. Burton has looked at a certain portion of the lithic material in his Doctoral dissertation. D. Donoghue of the University of Qeensland is currently analysing the organic and carbonised remains from these sites. J.P. White (1977) analysed Christensen‘s ethnographic collection of stone axes. Furthermore, over the years, the field and other records and the excavated finds have also been widely dispersed. During the months of December 1982 and July 1983 I have painstakingly put together all the relevant information regarding the site that I was to analyse from the scattered remains of the original notes and those compiled by others who had worked on the collection after Christensen‘s tragic death. This included having to copy his field note books, of which only the carbon copies could be found. Briefly these are some of the logistical shortcomings. Therefore, it is only fair at the outset to ask the reader to note that this thesis is set within the confines of these limitations and should be viewed as such.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here we show that by ~164 kyr ago ( +/-12 kyr) at Pinnacle Point (on the south coast of South Africa) humans expanded their diet to include marine resources, perhaps as a response to these harsh environmental conditions. The earliest previous evidence for human use of marine resources and coastal habitats was dated to ~125 kyr ago. Coincident with this diet and habitat expansion is an early use and modification of pigment, probably for symbolic behaviour, as well as the production of bladelet stone tool technology, previously dated to post-70 kyr ago.

Mariani:2016southern,"Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere. While it is well established that the current anthropogenic-driven trend in SAM is responsible for decreased rainfall in southern Australia, its role in driving fire regimes in this region has not been explored. We examined the connection between fire activity and SAM in southwest Tasmania, which lies in the latitudinal band of strongest correlation between SAM and rainfall in the Southern Hemisphere. We reveal that fire activity during a fire season is significantly correlated with the phase of SAM in the preceding year using superposed epoch analysis. We then synthesized new 14 charcoal records from southwest Tasmania spanning the last 1000 years, revealing a tight coupling between fire activity and SAM at centennial timescales, observing a multicentury increase in fire activity over the last 500 years and a spike in fire activity in the 21st century in response to natural and anthropogenic SAM trends.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Comparison of our SWW paleoclimate records with data tracking the ITCZ, oceanic circulation, and insolation reveals clearly synchronous and in-phase ITCZ-SWW dynamics between 12 and 5 ka, indicating a tight coupling between the tropics and southern mid-latitudes in response to ocean circulation and insolation.

Wavelet coherence analysis between regional charcoal influxes from southern South America (SSA) and western Tasmania (WTAS) shows a tight periodicity coherence from 12 to ∼6 ka, supporting synchronous SWW-driven climatic change in these areas. The same analysis between the regional Tasmania charcoal influx and an ENSO proxy suggests a coherent pattern of frequency variability between these records since ∼6 ka, highlighting the importance of ENSO in altering fire regimes in this region. Our data also provides insights into the non-stationarity of the climate system in space and time and highlights the potential limitations of modern climatic relationships for informing our understanding of the global climate system.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mariani:2017thesis,"Under the current changing climatic regime, in which wildfires are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude, it is important we gain a better understanding on past climatic trends and fire activity to properly manage fires and landscapes, preserve valuable natural ecosystems and protect human lives and properties. Fire activity is especially projected to increase in temperate regions, such as Australia's southeast. In this context, western Tasmania represents a key region where the environmental impacts of wildfires can be disastrous for the remnant pockets of fire-sensitive vegetation. Climate influence on fire activity and vegetation dynamics operates at multiple timescales, from inter-annual to multi-millennial. Given the time limitation of historical records, we need to look at long-term records to gain a better understanding on what modulates fire activity and how changes in fire regimes influence ecosystem dynamics. This PhD project aimed to a) identify the climate drivers of short- and long-term fire variability in western Tasmania and b) quantify climate- and fire-driven vegetation changes in this region throughout the Holocene. To understand the short-term drivers of fire activity in western Tasmania, I explored the relationship between the main climate modes of the Southern Hemisphere and a documentary record of fire occurrence from this region. This analysis suggested that the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) -an index for the position and strength of SWW is strongly correlated with inter-annual fire activity across western Tasmania during the last 25 years. Moreover, the persistent positive trend in SAM recorded during the last 500 years was found to be tightly coupled to increased biomass burning within the same region. To understand the long-term landscape changes in western Tasmania, I combined high resolution pollen and charcoal analyses, coupled with recently developed mathematical modelling of pollen dispersal and productivity. Within this Thesis, I applied pollen dispersal models to calibrate the pollen-vegetation relationship for the first time in Australia. This method involves two steps: (1) a modern pollen analysis coupled with distance-weighted vegetation data to calibrate the present-day pollen-vegetation relationships and (2) an application of these relationships to a fossil pollen record to produce past vegetation cover estimates. The application of pollen dispersal models proved the biases inherent in previous interpretations of pollen spectra from western Tasmania. Specifically, the results from these analyses showed that this region was mostly dominated by treeless moorland vegetation, supporting the identification of western Tasmania as a cultural landscape. Moreover, my results showed that land-cover changes throughout the Holocene occurred in response to climatic change and a shift in fire regimes due to ENSO/SWW interactions.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Mariani:2019rainfall,"Aim: To understand the long-term drivers of biomass burning in the sclerophyll-dominated forests of Australia. Location: Swallow Lagoon, North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia. Time period: Last ca. 8 kyr. Major taxa studied: Eucalyptus sensu lato, Leptospermum and Casuarinaceae. Methods: High-resolution pollen and charcoal analyses were undertaken on a ca. 8 kyr sediment record and compared with an independent quantitative precipitation reconstruction inferred from leaf carbon isotopes from the same site. We performed Principal Component Analysis to extract the main vegetation trends around Swallow Lagoon. We then compared vegetation changes to local charcoal records to understand the climate-vegetation-fire relationships under different rainfall regimes. The trends in pollen, charcoal and rainfall were analysed using Generalized Additive Models and wavelet coherence. Results: Relatively high Casuarinaceae pollen abundance and high charcoal influx were found prior to 3.4 ka, during a phase of high rainfall. Between 3.4 and 1.5 ka there was an increase in Leptospermum-type pollen abundance in concert with a decline in both rainfall and charcoal influx. After 1.5 ka low rainfall was generally maintained and a significant increase in Eucalyptus was detected, along with an increase in microscopic charcoal. Main conclusions: Our study, from a sclerophyll forest setting that is typical of ~30 percent of Australia's vegetation, provides a unique example of complex climate-biomass-fire feedbacks and highlights biomass limitation of fire activity. High rainfall at Swallow Lagoon is linked to dense Casuarinaceae-dominated forests and high fire activity prior to 3.4 ka. Between 3.4 and 1.5 ka, a decline in rainfall leads to reduced biomass burning during a phase dominated by shrub communities. After 1.5 ka, a change in fuel type was related to a transition to an open eucalypt forest and greater microscopic charcoal influx.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mariani:2019subalpine,"Climate change is affecting the distribution of species and the functioning of ecosystems. For species that are slow growing and poorly dispersed, climate change can force a lag between the distributions of species and the geographic distributions of their climatic envelopes, exposing species to the risk of extinction. Climate also governs the resilience of species and ecosystems to disturbance, such as wildfire. Here we use species distribution modelling and palaeoecology to assess and test the impact of vegetation--climate disequilibrium on the resilience of an endangered fire-sensitive rainforest community to fires. First, we modelled the probability of occurrence of Athrotaxis spp. and Nothofagus gunnii rainforest in Tasmania (hereon 'montane rainforest') as a function of climate. We then analysed three pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 7,500 cal year BP from within both high (n = 1) and low (n = 2) probability of occurrence areas. Our study indicates that climatic change between 3,000 and 4,000 cal year bp induced a disequilibrium between montane rainforests and climate that drove a loss of resilience of these communities. Current and future climate change are likely to shift the geographic distribution of the climatic envelopes of this plant community further, suggesting that current high--resilience locations will face a reduction in resilience. Coupled with the forecast of increasing fire activity in southern temperate regions, this heralds a significant threat to this and other slow growing, poorly dispersed and fire sensitive forest systems that are common in the southern mid to high latitudes.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mariotti:2019var,"Marine sedimentary archives are well dated and often span several glacial cycles; cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in their detrital quartz grains could thus offer the opportunity to reconstruct a wealth of past denudation rates. However, these archives often comprise sediments much finer (<250 µm) than typically analyzed in 10Be studies, and few studies have measured 10Be concentrations in quartz grains smaller than 100 µm or assessed the impacts of mixing, grain size, and interannual variability on the 10Be concentrations of such fine-grained sediments. Here, we analyzed the in situ cosmogenic 10Be concentrations of quartz grains in the 50–100 and 100–250 µm size fractions of sediments from the Var basin (southern French Alps) to test the reliability of denudation rates derived from 10Be analyses of fine sands. The Var basin has a short transfer zone and highly variable morphology, climate, and geology, and we test the impact of these parameters on the observed 10Be concentrations. Both analyzed size fractions returned similar 10Be concentrations in downstream locations, notably at the Var's outlet, where concentrations ranged from (4.02±0.78)×104 to (4.40±0.64)×104 atoms g−1 of quartz. By comparing expected and observed 10Be concentrations at three major river junctions, we interpret that sediment mixing is efficient throughout the Var basin. We resampled four key locations 1 year later, and despite variable climatic parameters during that period, interannual 10Be concentrations were in agreement within uncertainties, except for one upper subbasin. The 10Be-derived denudation rates of Var subbasins range from 0.10±0.01 to 0.57±0.09 mm yr−1, and spatial variations are primarily controlled by the average subbasin slope. The integrated denudation rate of the entire Var basin is 0.24±0.04 mm yr−1, in agreement with other methods. Our results demonstrate that fine-grained sediments (50–250 µm) may return accurate denudation rates and are thus potentially suitable targets for future 10Be applications, such as studies of paleo-denudation rates using offshore sediments.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Maroulis:2000cooper,"Detailed knowledge of the fluvial history and stratigraphy of Quaternary deposits in semi-arid central Australia is at present poorly understood. This thesis presents a detailed study of the Quaternary fluvial and aeolian deposits in the Cooper Creek floodplain of southwest Queensland. The present Cooper floodplain is very low gradient (~0.00015) and consists several metres of near surface muds characterised by abundant shallow surficial braid-like and reticulate channels, and less common but widespread deeper and narrower anastomosing channels, some with sandy beds. These deeper channels often interconnect much larger waterholes, some of which have scoured beneath the m u d into an extensive underlying sand sheet which was deposited primarily by laterally migrating rivers during the middle to late Quaternary. Extensive subsurface excavations revealed evidence of lateral accretionary surfaces, point bar development and upward-fining sequences. In a very few locations, the planform of these meandering channels is still visible within the muds of the present floodplain surface. Floodplain muds were deposited35 m. The TL (thermoluminescence) evidence indicates that the fluvial sand-regime dominated oxygen isotope Stages 5-7 with a maximum recorded TL date in this study of >700 ka at a depth of 27 m and represents the oldest TL dated fluvial deposit in Australia. The peak of fluvial sand activity is -100 ka, while m u d transport dominated during Stage 1 and 3 pluvials. Good agreement exists between the fluvial TL dates and worldwide interglacials (Stages 1, 3, 5 and 7). However, there is also a strong fluvial signature evident during the glacial Stage 6 (186-127 ka). During the transitional phases between sand and mud-load regimes, source bordering dunes were developed: the remnants of which appear at the surface of the contemporary Cooper Creek floodplain. Interestingly, the bulk of the dune TL dates range between Stages 3 and 1 with a pronounced phase of activity evident during the pluvial Stage 3, whilst very few dune dates appear in Stage 2. The role of source-bordering dunes is an important factor influencing channel morphology of the anastomosing channels. A model of channel development is presented using evidence from rare but recent evidence of channel change. Climatic change during the mid to late-Quaternary is proposed as the major factor influencing the palaeohydrology and sediment transport of Cooper Creek, however, the role of neotectonic events cannot be discounted.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Maroulis:2007cooper,"This study provides an interpretation of interrelated Quaternary fluvial and aeolian activity related to climate change on Cooper Creek in the Lake Eyre Basin in southwestern Queensland, central Australia. The extensive muddy floodplain is characterised by buried sandy palaeochannels now almost entirely invisible but stratigraphically connected to source-bordering dunes that emerge as distinctive sandy islands through the floodplain surface. Luminescence dating has identified pronounced periods of fluvial activity represented by abundant sandy alluvium from Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 8–3. While all these sandy fluvial episodes on Cooper Creek were much more powerful than anything subsequent, they appear to be ranked in order of declining activity. MIS 8–6 saw reworking of almost the entire floodplain whereas subsequent phases of reworking were far less extensive. Source-bordering dunes were derived from active sandy channels in late MIS 5 (∼85–80ka) and mid MIS 3 (50–40ka). After ∼40ka sand-channel activity largely ceased and the floodplains and channels were inundated with mud, isolating the dunes as emergent features. Although aeolian reworking of the upper parts of some dunes has continued to the present, they show remarkable resilience, having survived without appreciable migration for at least 40ka. Whilst the channels once determined the location of source-bordering dunes, in an interesting role reversal the remnant dunes now determine the position of many contemporary flood-channels and waterholes by deflection and confinement of overbank flows.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Marshall:2017oregon,"Climate regulation of erosion in unglaciated landscapes remains difficult to decipher. While climate may disrupt process feedbacks that would otherwise steer landscapes toward steady erosion, sediment transport processes tend to erase past climate landforms and thus bias landscape evolution interpretations.

Our results span the forested marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 3 (50–29 ka), the subalpine MIS 2 (29–14 ka), and the forested MIS 1 (14 ka to present). From 46 ka through 28.5 ka, erosion rates increased from 0.06 mm yr–1 to 0.23 mm yr–1, coincident with declining temperatures. Mean MIS 2 erosion rates remained at 0.21 mm yr–1 and declined with increasing MIS 1 temperatures to the modern mean rate of 0.08 mm yr–1. Paleoclimate reconstructions and a frost-weathering model suggest periglacial processes were vigorous between 35 and 17 ka. While steady erosion is often assumed, our results suggest that climate strongly modulates soil production and transport on glacial-interglacial time scales. By applying a cosmogenic paleo-erosion model to evaluate 10Be concentrations in our sedimentary archive, we demonstrate that the depth of soil mixing (which is climate-dependent) controls the lag time required for cosmogenic erosion rates to track actual values. Our results challenge the widely held assumption that climate has minimal impact on erosion rates in unglaciated midlatitude terrain, which invites reconsideration of the extent to which past climate regimes manifest in modern landscapes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Martin:1987lachlan,"The history of the vegetation based on palynology of the late Eocene to early Pleistocene sediments is presented here for the Lachlan River region. Grey carbonaceous clays of the alluvium in the valley and in the Hillston region of the eastern edge of the Murray Basin, are the most fruitful for palynology. Pollen has not been preserved upstream of Cowra but silicified wood is found in association with basalts. Early Miocene lava flows dammed the river and the lake which was formed drowned the local vegetation (Bishop 1985a). The palynological record and interpretations of the vegetation is one of periods of relative stability with small changes and a series of considerable, step-like change. The climate of the time is deduced from the parameters controlling generally similar modern vegetation. The main features are as follows: 1. From late Eocene to late Oligocene — early Miocene, Nothojagus is the most abundant pollen group and most of it is the brassii type. The vegetation was rainforest with reasonable diversity. The climate was very humid with a precipitation of about or above 1800mm. (The levels of precipitation given here are very general with no great accuracy: the trend is more important.) 2. In the late Oligocene — early Miocene, the Nothojagus content declines, particularly the brassii type. The vegetation was still rainforest. There was a decrease in precipitation, probably to about 1500mm. 3. In the early — mid Miocene, the Myrtaceae group was relatively more abundant. The assemblages are diverse, however, and contain many low frequency pollen types, which collectively may have accounted for a major portion of the vegetation, which was rainforest. 4. The mid Miocene was a time of considerable change. The brassii type of Nothojagus disappeared and pollen preservation ceases in the Hillston region. 5. In the mid — late Miocene, Myrtaceae were dominant but rainforest ta.xa were still present. The charcoal record, which had been low in the older, rainforest assemblages, increased considerably, suggesting that the myrtaceous vegetation was mainly wet sclerophyll. The precipitation decreased to about 1000-1500mm, with a definite dry season. Burninghad become a part of the environment. 6. In the early Pliocene, Nothojagus, the menziesii dsidfusca pollen types only, reappeared in the Lachlan Valley and gymnosperms were more abundant. Rainforest had returned, the precipitation increased to more than 1500mm and burning was infrequent. 7. In the mid — late Pliocene, Myrtaceae returned to dominance, precipitation decreased to the former levels of about 1000-1500mm and burning became more frequent. 8. In the late Pliocene — Pleistocene, the rainforest element disappeared and the precipitation decreased to about 500-800mm. 9. The forest cover dwindled and in the Pleistocene Gramineae and Compositae were abundant; indicative of woodland and grassland/herbfields. These major changes in vegetation and the inferred climatic changes may be related to changes in sea level and coincide with the major developments of circum-Antarctic oceanic circulation and ice cap formation on Antarctica.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
Martin:1994kurnell,"Pollen analysis of a 3.4 m core from residual fenland at the eastern end of Kurnell Peninsula shows that woodland cover of Eucalyptus spp., Angophora costata, Banksia integrifolia/B. serrata and Casuarina spp. suffered losses about 5000 BP when a nearby coastal protobarrier was destabilised by rising sea level, while rapidly-formed fen peat replaced slowly formed O2-depleted, algal and FeS-rich fine detritus gyttja. Fire frequency was low up to this time. Woodland partly recovered over a 2000 yr period despite heavier or more frequent firing coincident with the entry of hunter-gathering aboriginal (Pre-Bondaian) people. The peatland, formerly sedge/Triglochin, became dominated by marsh ferns between 4000 and 2000 BP; these were largely replaced during a major change to a more acid peat, with an expansion of Sphagnum bog elements, associated with acidiphilous diatoms. Minor destabilisation of local duneland ca. 1700 BP brought fine sand into the fen basin. Dryland plant cover increased after 1700 BP but mainly dominated locally by a more seral Monotoca/Leptospermum scrub. Bog has reverted to Baumea rubiginosa-Triglochin procera fen with few diatoms, possibly due to recent salt-spray access. This and the more seral vegetation may be linked to higher population density or greater continuity of tenure of later (Bondaian) aboriginal peoples, post-2000 BP.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

Surrounding vegetation was a grassy alpine herbfield with many Asteraceae, Apiaceae and Gentianella diemensis, corresponding to the regional Club Lake Zone C, dated to the same period. Astelia died out c. 6500 years before present approximately at the Club Lake C/D 1 boundary, marked by spread of Pomaderris in subjacent montane forests. Thereafter, shrubs, mainly Myrtaceae and Epacridaceae, and Restionaceae (Empodisma and Restio australis) dominated the bog. Epacris cf. paludosa and C. pityoides seem to have been the earliest shrubs to invade, Baeckea, probably B. gunniana, and Richea continentis reaching maximum prominence 5000–3000 years before present. Sphagnum was uncommon until recently. Regional arboreal pollen enable comparisons with other sites in south-eastern Australia but immigration of the tree-line species Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila (snowgum) is not well expressed in the pollen spectra. Surface and near-surface counts of this species are higher than at any preceding time, and correspond most closely to surface counts in adjacent young snowgum woodland. The co-occurrence of weed pollens, probably associated with the late 19th and early 20th century practice of summer pasturing stock on the alpine–subalpine tract, suggests that pasturing and burning, responsible for widespread severe fires on this range, led both to the formation of dense even-aged snowgum woodland that had been open and patchy at this altitude, and a spread of Sphagnum on the bog surface.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

Marwick:2002pilbara,"In this thesis I describe the results of my analysis of archaeological material and sediments excavated from four rockshelters on the northeast Hamersley Plateau, Western Australia and synthesise previously reported archaeological evidence from the inland Pilbara to answer two questions about Aboriginal occupation. The first question asks how humans in the inland Pilbara responded to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and compares their response to those of people in surrounding areas. Archaeological evidence from areas surrounding the inland Pilbara, such as the northwest coast, the interior and the Kimberley, indicate that people abandoned sites or used them less frequently during the LGM. A unique and significant feature of the inland Pilbara is the Hamersley Plateau, a massive plateau and escarpment feature that concentrates plateau runoff into long and deep gorges with aquifer-fed pools. Previously reported sites in the inland Pilbara are not near the escarpment and suggest abandonment or reduced frequency of use during the LGM, but I present new evidence from Milly's Cave, located near the escarpment, that indicates increased use during the LGM. This evidence indicates that the pliancy of hunter-gatherer adaptive systems during the LGM may have been underestimated and the local as well as regional environments are significant in understanding hunter-gatherer adaptations to climate change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Marx:2021monsoon,"The Indo-Australian Summer Monsoon (IASM) is the dominant climate feature of northern Australia, affecting rainfall/runoff patterns over a large portion of the continent and exerting a major control on the ecosystems of Australia's Top End, including the viability of wetland ecosystems and the structure of the woody savanna. We examined the behaviour the IASM from 35 kyr using proxy data preserved in the sediments of Table Top Swamp, a small seasonal swamp in northern Australia. Elemental data, stable C and N isotopes, pollen and sedimentary data were combined to develop a picture of monsoon activity and landscape and ecosystem response. Results demonstrated that between 35 and 25 ka conditions were drier and more stable than present, with a more grass dominated savanna and limited wetland development, implying reduced IASM activity. After ~25 ka, there is evidence of increased moisture at the study site, but also increased IASM variability. However, despite evidence of at least periodic increases in moisture, including periods of wetland establishment, the IASM displayed a subdued response to peak precession insolation forcing by comparison to the other global monsoon systems. Instead, the greatest change occurred from ~10 ka when the continental shelf flooded, increasing moisture advection to the study site and resulting in establishment of a quasi-permeant wetland. Whereas the early Holocene was marked by both the onset of pollen preservation and a wetter vegetation mosaic, indicative of a consistently active IASM, the mid-late Holocene was marked by drier vegetation, increased fire, but also increased C3 vegetation and runoff, implying increased IASM variability. Holocene changes in ecosystem dynamics occur coincident with an expansion in human population, which likely also influenced vegetation and landscape response at the study site.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Other orders that featured as prey were ants, crickets/grasshoppers, butterflies/moths, spiders, and true bugs.

Matley:2020nullarbor,"Fossil pollen from two stalagmites is examined to reconstruct a c. 2400-year history of vegetation change on the Nullarbor Plain. Environmental changes are reflected by variation in chenopod species abundance, and by a peak in woody taxa between 1000 and 800 years ago which is interpreted as evidence of increased moisture conditions associated with a positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode. While no strong palynological signal is observed at the time of European colonization of Australia, a significant change occurs in the past 40 years, which is interpreted as a vegetation response to a recorded fire event. As speleothems (secondary cave carbonates including stalagmites, stalactites and flowstones) rarely contain enough fossil pollen for analysis, the taphonomic biases of speleothem archives remain poorly understood. This study, as well as being a high-resolution record of environmental change, presents an opportunity to examine these taphonomic filters. The record is shown to be sensitive to episodic deposition of presumably insect-borne pollen, but overall appears to provide a faithful representation of local and regional vegetation change. There is a need for greater research into taphonomic processes, if speleothem palynology is to be developed as a viable alternative to lacustrine sediments in the investigation of past environmental change.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

No sediments were dated between ∼70 and 25 ka, but renewed sediment delivery from the Flinders Ranges and re-deposition characterised the playa margin LGM and the early Holocene (Unit 2). The most recent phase of depositional activity is reflected by source-bordering dunes and lake marginal spit formation (Unit 3). Short-lived flooding events in the late Holocene are recorded by lake floor sediments and terminal splays (Unit 4).

The available chronology of these deposits was so far based on thermoluminescence (TL) dating and indicated maximum flood magnitudes during the Last Glacial Maximum in contrast with more arid conditions as deduced from other archives of the region. This study revisits plunge pool deposits at Wangi Falls by applying multiple and single-grain Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz and high-resolution gamma spectrometry, supported by radiocarbon dating of organic material. The aim is to reappraise the existing chronology and investigate if the deposits are affected by partial bleaching, post-depositional mixing and/or problems related to annual dose determination. The latter seems to have a minor impact on the ages at most. Equivalent Dose (De) distributions are broad, in particular for single grains, but apparently not result from partial bleaching or post-depositional mixing. Rather, microdosimetry caused by radiation hotspots in the sediment and zircon inclusions in the quartz grains is considered problematic for these sediments.

May:2017sandstone,"The sandstone peak‐forest landscape in Zhangjiajie UNESCO Global Geopark of Hunan Province, China, is characterized by >3000 vertical pillars and peak walls of up to 350 m height, representing a spectacular example of sandstone landform variety. Few studies have addressed the mechanisms and timescales of the longer‐term evolution of this landscape, and have focused on fluvial incision. We use in situ cosmogenic nuclides combined with GIS analysis to investigate the erosional processes contributing to the formation of pillars and peak‐forests, and discuss their relative roles in the formation and decay of the landscape. Model maximum‐limiting bedrock erosion rates are the highest along the narrow fluvial channels and valleys at the base of the sandstone pillars (~83–122 mm kyr−1), and lowest on the peak wall tops (~2.5 mm kyr−1). Erosion rates are highly variable and intermediate along vertical sandstone peak walls and pillars (~30 to 84 mm kyr−1). Catchment‐wide denudation rates from river sediment vary between ~26 and 96 mm kyr−1 and are generally consistent with vertical wall retreat rates. This highlights the importance of wall retreat for overall erosion in the sandstone peak‐forest. In combination with GIS‐derived erosional volumes, our results suggest that the peak‐forest formation in Zhangjiajie commenced in the Pliocene, and that the general evolution of the landscape followed our sequential refined model: (i) slow lowering rates following initial uplift; (ii) fast plateau dissection by headward knickpoint propagation along joints and faults followed by; (iii) increasing contribution of wall retreat in the well‐developed pillars and peak‐forests and a gradual decrease in overall denudation rates, leading to; (iv) the final consumption of pillars and peak‐forests. Our study provides an approach for quantifying the complex interplay between multiple geomorphic processes as required to assess the evolutionary pathways of other sandstone peak‐forest landscapes across the globe.

May:2017washover,"Washover fans typically form due to barrier overwash or breaching and coastal inundation and generally represent geomorphological and depositional evidence of intense storms. Few studies have investigated the chronostratigraphy of washover fans in order to infer magnitude/frequency patterns of extreme-wave events over longer time scales. Here we present new data on the chronostratigraphy of late Holocene washover fans in the Exmouth Gulf (Western Australia) by using ground penetrating radar and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey techniques, as well as geomorphological, sedimentological and chronological investigations. This study aims to (i) provide a detailed characterization of the washover fans' geomorphology and stratigraphical architecture; (ii) document depositional processes involved in their formation; (iii) establish a chronostratigraphy based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL); and (iv) understand the significance of the washover fans for recording past tropical cyclone (TC) activity. The fans consist of multiple sequences of sand, shell debris and coral rubble comprising depositional units related to TC-induced inundation. The units are separated by palaeosurfaces with incipient soil formation, formed during periods of reduced depositional activity. In combination with the interpretation of a UAV-based high-resolution digital surface model, multiple phases of reactivation are inferred. OSL results allow the establishment of a local long-term TC record and suggest storm-induced deposition at ~170, ~360, ~850 and ~1300 years ago. Further units were dated to ~1950, ~2300, and ~2850 years ago. The chronology of TC events is consistent with other work relating TC activity with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sea surface temperature (SST) patterns, corroborating the regional palaeotempestological relevance of this unique geomorphological record.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

In the uppermost, fine-grained and peaty section of the core, two different organic fractions (pollen concentrate and humins) were dated with AMS radiocarbon yielding significantly different chronologies. While this could point to the incorporation of younger pollen into the profile along seasonal dry cracks, older humins may also move up in the profile due to vertical mixing. Additional, spatially highly resolved measurements of the bulk OSL signal (Ln and Ln/Tn) combined with data on down-core variation in K, Th, and U concentration, grain size and moisture content were used to (i) guide the development of an age-depth relationship (i.e. age model) for the entire core based on three different data input scenarios, and (ii) test the applicability of novel luminescence screening techniques in seasonal swamp settings. Results suggest only minor differences among the applied models and scenarios, providing an overall reliable representation of the depositional history in the swamp. Even though all resulting age-depth models have relatively large uncertainties in the lower part of the core, there are significant changes in sedimentation rate over time, providing a chronological basis for a more detailed palaeoenvironmental analysis at TTS. The approach used may also be useful in developing age models in other complex environments, and has shown the importance of understanding carbon pathways as well as controls on luminescence signals when developing age models.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
May:2018giralia,"Past coastal flooding events may be inferred from geomorphic and sedimentary archives, including particular landforms (e.g., beach ridges, washover fans), deposits (e.g., washover sediments in lagoons) or erosional features (e.g., erosional scarps within strandplains). In Giralia Bay, southern Exmouth Gulf (Western Australia), sandy ridge sequences in supratidal elevations form the landward margin of extensive mudflats. The formation of these ridges is assumed to be mainly driven by tropical cyclones (TCs), although their depositional processes need to be clarified. We investigated the supratidal sandy ridge sequence in Giralia Bay by carrying out process monitoring, geomorphological mapping by means of an unmanned aerial vehicle survey, as well as sedimentological and geochronological investigations and multivariate statistics. Based on the resulting data, this study aims at (i) identifying the most important driving processes to form the sandy ridges; (ii) establishing their chronostratigraphy; and (iii) understanding their significance for recording past TC activity. Trench excavations revealed sandy units that are interbedded with mud layers at the base, similar to the present distal mudflat sediments. On top, mud intercalations recede, and sand layers of varying grain size distribution dominate. In the upper part of the trenches, younger sediment layers onlap older ones documenting the stepwise seaward accretion of the ridges onto the mudflat. While our data suggests that tidal processes have only limited effects on ridge activity, sediment transport, erosion and deposition seems to be driven by both TC-induced storm surges and high magnitude precipitation events causing surface discharge. ...

The bulk of the ore (soft yellow limonite) is subsurface, but there is a horseshoe-shaped outcrop of hard cap about 2km in diameter, which overlooks a flat plain wherein lies the headwaters of the Fortescue River. Kingsley Palmer (then a Research Officer of the Western Australian Museum) surveyed this area and found several rockshelters with traces of occupation, principally along the southern margin of the Marra Mamba outcrop. At that time the mining company was expected to proceed with development of Orebody XXIX and the Museum therefore decided that the archaeological significance of these sites should be further tested.

McBride:2020turnaround,"Holocene regressive strandplains that preserve a series of former shorelines are extensive on coasts that were remote from major Pleistocene ice sheets (for example, Australia and Brazil), whereas transgressive barrier islands are typical in glacial forebulge regions (for example, North America and Europe). In strandplains, the regressive phase of strandline development was preceded by a transgressive phase during the final stages of postglacial sea-level rise. This study examines the turnaround from transgression to regression through chronostratigraphic description of three barrier systems in south-eastern Australia: Seven Mile Beach, Bengello Beach and Pedro Beach. The authors reconstruct geomorphic and depositional histories using ground-penetrating radar and vibracores along transects across the landwardmost ridges, and optically-stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating. At the Seven Mile Beach barrier system, extensive washover deposits are preserved that include distinctive, landward-directed, flame-shaped washover fans along the bayside shoreline of the landwardmost ridge. Landward-dipping ground-penetrating radar reflections in radargrams provide evidence of the culmination of the transgressive phase and transition into the regressive phase dominated by progradation, evidenced by the change to seaward-dipping reflections. A similar progradational plain formed at the Bengello Beach barrier system, but transgressive deposits are largely absent at the site investigated, where an eroded headland created limited accommodation space until sand supply was sufficient for progradation. The Pedro Beach barrier system depositional history is more complex. There, a smaller embayment filled rapidly during the mid-Holocene, and transgressive sands were deposited as sea level reached its present level and impounded a wetland. Accommodation space in the embayment was filled by ca 4000 years ago. Overall, results indicate that the Holocene turnaround transition occurred between 8400 and 7000 years ago, and was preserved at the landward margin of these three strandplains. Holocene morphostratigraphy differs among sites primarily as a function of sea level, sediment supply and antecedent topography.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

It has yielded a pollen record extending back over 35,000 years, which has provided one of the very few proxy climatic records for the interior of southern Africa in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The current investigation of the morphology and sedimentology of the site has revealed that the peat mound formed due to artesian conditions at the spring, but that accumulation of the thick peat succession was made possible because of clastic sedimentation on the surrounding piedmont which in turn was brought about by aggradation on the adjacent Nyl River floodplain. The peat mound has remained elevated relative to the surrounding piedmont for most of the 35,000 year period. Aggradation of the mound was slower during the Late Pleistocene than the Holocene (0.06–0.1 m/1000 year and 0.2–0.38 m/1000 year, respectively). Controlled archaeological excavations yielded a diverse late Pleistocene fauna preserved in peat and sand in the mound. A 1 m thick, coarse sand horizon at the base of the peat deposit contained a rich Middle Stone Age (>30 k year) lithic assemblage.

Mormopterus norfolkensis (eastcoast free-tailed bat) is a threatened insectivorous bat species of which little is known. The aim of this thesis was to address knowledge gaps regarding key aspects of the ecology of M. norfolkensis, including habitat, roost selection and diet. Habitat use was investigated at multiple spatial scales, using three independent and systematically collected datasets. Overall, preferred habitat for M. norfolkensis was identified as productive floodplain areas, especially freshwater wetland, with urban landuse and dry sclerophyll forest avoided. Habitat use by M. norfolkensis was contrasted with two other morphologically similar and sympatric molossid species. Despite having similar morphologies and echolocation designs, differences in habitat use among species were found. The broad habitat types predicted from habitat models prepared at a regional-scale, using presence - absence data, were generally consistent with local-scale models, prepared using an index of activity. However, the fine-scale predictive ability of regional-scale models was poor, indicating that a cautious approach be adopted regarding their use at fine-scales, particularly when the consequences of error are severe. In a detailed study of roost selection by a maternity colony, lactating female M. norfolkensis were found to be faithful to two patches of mangrove forest close to where they were captured. Females regularly switched roosts and roosted in hollows singularly or in small groups. Maternity roosts were located in locally unique mangrove forest which had abundant hollow-bearing trees and a stable microclimate.

McDonald:2008sydney,"This monograph is based on PhD research completed at the Australian National University in 1994. The research examines prehistoric rock art from the Sydney region in coastal southeastern Australia. The rock art occurs in two distinct contexts provided by the sandstone bedrock which defines this region. Engraving (or petroglyph) sites occur in open locations on horizontal platforms. In rockshelter locations there is pigment art (drawings, stencils and paintings) and occasionally engravings. The principal aim of this research was to define a model for cultural interaction to describe a prehistoric art system. Information exchange theory provided the basis for this proposed model. By perceiving ‘style’ from a functional perspective the region’s art was seen as a conduit for the expression of social affiliations. The concept of social context, e.g. public versus private, has been extremely important in developing this argument. So has the notion that style is a means of nonverbal communication used to negotiate identity. ... [_truncated_]",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2023-01-11 09:27:20.159 +0100
McDonald:2014pigment,The Canning Stock Route Project (Rock Art and Jukurrpa) has yielded the first radiocarbon dates for rock paintings in the Western Desert of Australia. We report on the results of a large-scale project to directly-date both charcoal and inorganic-pigmented pictographs using plasma oxidation combined with accelerator mass spectrometry. This project has yielded the largest number of art dates from any region in the world: one site alone has produced 12 art dates (from 30 collected samples). Our work advances the testing of the dating method through the systematic use of replicates and explores the methodological implications of dating very small samples (10–40 μg carbon). Thirty-six radiocarbon age determinations range from 3000 years ago to Modern. The results contribute to an understanding of art production in the Australian arid zone during a period of extreme cultural dynamism. We have demonstrated for the first time that significant late Holocene changes in discard rates of artefacts and technological organization of the extractive technologies of implements such seed-grinders is matched by a very high level of stylistic heterogeneity in the art – which has been systematically dated within and between dialect groups.,2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McDonald:2017foragers,"The Dampier Archipelago (Murujuga) in northwestern Australia is a rich rock art province located in an arid-maritime cultural landscape. The archipelago juts into the Indian Ocean just north of the Tropic of Capricorn. When people started inscribing this rugged granophyre landscape it was an inland range more than 100 km from the coast. Murujuga rock art is contextualized by a 47,000-year-old occupation sequence from the Pilbara, a model for stylistic change, and a predictive model that envisages how people may have adapted to this eventual seascape. Initial testing of an outer island suggests that highly mobile coastal foragers took advantage of interior ranges across the Abydos Plain as sea levels rose after the Last Glacial Maximum. This article describes for the first time evidence for Australia's earliest domestic stone structures (dated to between 8063 and 7355 cal BP) and tests the predictive model. Rosemary Island is an inscribed landscape that reveals the emergence of an arid island and provides insights into the dynamics of mobile arid hunter-fisher-gatherers in the early Holocene. It adds to the body of Australian evidence for island abandonment with insulation, but with minimal evidence for subsequent (re)colonization.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McDonald:2018backed,"The “Backed Artefact Symmetry Index” (BASI) provides a measure with which to describe geometric variation in Australian backed artefacts, and Peter Hiscock has suggested that desert versions of this artefact type will be more symmetrical than their coastal counterparts. The re-excavated Serpent's Glen (Karnatukul) site and nearby site of Wirrili have produced a large assemblage of backed artefacts. These Western Desert assemblages allow for the testing of BASI. The backed artefacts demonstrate significantly more variability than predicted, demonstrating that all technological debates benefit from larger well-dated assemblages. The signalling information observed in these sites’ pigment art repertoires, combined with this versatility in the toolkits, increases our understanding of the complexity of middle and late Holocene highly mobile foragers in the Australian arid zone.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McDonald:2018glen,"The re-excavation of Karnatukul (Serpent's Glen) has provided evidence for the human occupation of the Australian Western Desert to before 47,830 cal. BP (modelled median age). This new sequence is 20,000 years older than the previous known age for occupation at this site. Re-excavation of Karnatukul aimed to contextualise the site's painted art assemblage. We report on analyses of assemblages of stone artefacts and pigment art, pigment fragments, anthracology, new radiocarbon dates and detailed sediment analyses. Combined these add significantly to our understanding of this earliest occupation of Australia's Western Desert. The large lithic assemblage of over 25,000 artefacts includes a symmetrical geometric backed artefact dated to 45,570-41,650 cal. BP. The assemblage includes other evidence for hafting technology in its earliest phase of occupation. This research recalibrates the earliest Pleistocene occupation of Australia's desert core and confirms that people remained in this part of the arid zone during the Last Glacial Maximum. Changes in occupation intensity are demonstrated throughout the sequence: at the late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, the mid-Holocene and then during the last millennium. Karnatukul documents intensive site use with a range of occupation activities and different signalling behaviours during the last 1,000 years. This correlation of rock art and occupation evidence refines our understanding of how Western Desert peoples have inscribed their landscapes in the recent past, while the newly described occupation sequence highlights the dynamic adaptive culture of the first Australians, supporting arguments for their rapid very early migration from the coasts and northern tropics throughout the arid interior of the continent.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McDonald:2018murujuga,"The Dampier Archipelago (including the Burrup Peninsula), now generally known as Murujuga, is a significant rock art province in north-western Australia which documents the transition of an arid-maritime cultural landscape through time. This archipelago of 42 islands has only existed since the mid-Holocene, when the sea level rose to its current height. Previous excavations across Murujuga have demonstrated Holocene occupation sequences, but the highly weathered rock art depicting extinct fauna and early styles suggests a far greater age for occupation and rock art production. The archaeological record from the Pilbara and Carnarvon bioregions demonstrates human occupation through 50,000 years of environmental change. While the regional prehistory and engraved art suggests that people were producing art here since they first occupied these arid rocky slopes, no clear evidence of Pleistocene occupation has been found across Murujuga, until now. Murujuga Rockshelter (MR1) reveals that occupation of this shelter began late in the Last Glacial Maximum, when the Murujuga Ranges would likely have served as one of a network of Pilbara refugia. In the terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene, and likely in tandem with the last stages of sea level rise, the proportion of artefacts manufactured on exotic lithologies declines sharply, revealing a changed foraging range and increasing territorial focus in this period of increased demographic packing as the coastline advanced. Abandonment of the site as early as 7000 years ago is indicated, suggesting a changing resource focus to the increasingly proximal coastline. This paper provides the first evidence of how Aboriginal people adapted their Pleistocene procurement strategies in response to significant environmental and landscape changes in Murujuga. This changing logistical strategy provides an explanation for the increased rock art production in the terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

McDowell:2015bettongia,"In 1933, geologist and explorer Michael Terry collected the skull of a small macropodid captured by members of his party near Lake Mackay, western Northern Territory. In 1957, this skull was described as the sole exemplar of a distinct subspecies, Bettongia penicillata anhydra, but was later synonymized with B. lesueur and thereafter all but forgotten. We use a combination of craniodental morphology and ancient mitochondrial DNA to confirm that the Lake Mackay specimen is taxonomically distinct from all other species of Bettongia and recognize an additional specimen from a Western Australian Holocene fossil accumulation. B. anhydra is morphologically and genetically most similar to B. lesueur but differs in premolar shape, rostrum length, dentary proportions, and molar size gradient. In addition, it has a substantial mitochondrial cytochrome b pairwise distance of 9.6-12% relative to all other bettongs. The elevation of this recently extinct bettong to species status indicates that Australia's mammal extinction record over the past 2 centuries is even worse than currently accepted. Like other bettongs, B. anhydra probably excavated much of its food and may have performed valuable ecological services that improved soil structure and water infiltration and retention, as well as playing an important role in the dispersal of seeds and mycorrhizal fungal spores. All extant species of Bettongia have experienced extensive range contractions since European colonization and some now persist only on island refugia.

McDowell:2015seton,"It is widely accepted that most larger Australian vertebrates were extinct by 40 ka. The reliability of <20-ka radiocarbon (14C) ages on charcoal stratigraphically associated with sthenurine (short-faced) kangaroo tooth fragments from Seton Rockshelter, Kangaroo Island, have therefore proven contentious. Some researchers have argued these fossils were in situ, while others have claimed they were reworked. To address this we obtained new 14C ages on bones from the site. These bone ages are not only consistent with earlier charcoal ages, but are in near-perfect stratigraphic order, providing strong support for the site's stratigraphic integrity. Our analyses indicate units aged 21-17 ka were primarily accumulated by Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and owls (Tyto species), after which humans became the primary accumulation agent. The tight chronology, faunal trends and current lack of evidence for older layers from which specimens could have been reworked suggest the sthenurine remains may be in situ. However, because attempts to directly date sthenurine material failed, we cannot confidently assert that they survived to this time. Therefore, Seton Rockshelter may be best excluded from the Pleistocene extinction debate until the site can be re-excavated and more conclusive evidence collected, including more complete or directly datable sthenurine remains.

McElroy:2017censorship,"In a degrading landscape, does the episodic nature of erosion affect observed erosion rates in a systematic way, and can one account for the effects? We present a null hypothesis for surface change rate variations based on minimal assumptions about the processes of topographic evolution. Variance in erosion along with censorship of topographic change distributions combine to act as a first-order control on time-scale dependence of erosion rates. In general, censorship is ubiquitous, and as a result, time-scale dependence of rates is likely to apply to almost every system. In detail, this occurs because at short time scales, surface changes can be censored from field measurements that become inherently incorporated by natural surface evolution at longer time scales. Additionally, the granularity of systems implies minimum time scales below which specific rate measurements have no physical interpretation. Finally, we show the existence of a crossover time scale at which the short-term rate dependence of a process gives way to the long-term rate that is no longer subject to censoring. ...

However, pollen diagrams from regions up to 150km from the volcanic centre show that widespread fires were common over an appreciable period after both eruptions. It appears that damage to foliage by tephra fall increases mortality of canopy trees, open forest to the drying effects of sun and wind, and also increases the total fuel stock. The result is that the damaged forests are more susceptible to fire.

McGlone:1984ohinewai,"The Ohinewai peatlands occupy 15 km2 near Lake Waikare, south Auckland. The peats average 6--9 m in depth, and overlie a grey-green lacustrine mud (3--11 m thick). The lacustrine mud was deposited in a proto-Lake Waikare between 20,000 and 7,000 yr bp, and pollen analysis shows that open shrubland-grassland vegetation was dominant for at least a portion of this time. The basal peat ranges in age from 7,000--6,000 yr bp. The peat formed in an oligotrophic raised bog during the drainage and contraction of the proto-Lake Waikare, a process which may have been caused by a drop in sea level. Pollen analysis of the peat shows that conifer-hardwood forest, similar to that of the present, was dominant throughout. Ascarina lucida and Dacrydium colensoi, trees which are extinct, or nearly so, in the region today, were present until at least 2,000 yr BP. There was little change in the forest between 7,000 and 2,000 yr bp, except for a marked increase in Agathis austrahs at around 3,000 yr BP, which may indicate a trend towards a drier climate.

McGlone:1995awatere,"Pollen analysis of a high altitude bog (Winterton Bog) and an alluvial soil sequence in the upper Awatere catchment on the western flanks of the Inland Kaikoura Range, and radiocarbon dates on wood and charcoal from the Marlborough region, have established a Holocene, (post 10 000 years B.P.) vegetation history for this area. The upper slopes of the catchment were almost entirely clad in Podocarpus and Phyllocladus dominant conifer/broad-leaved forest and the valley floor in Prumnopitys taxifolia for most of the Holocene, despite occasional forest fires in the region. Nothofagus forest spread into the wetter, mountainous region west of the Awatere valley at around c. 6000 years B.P., but failed to establish more than scattered stands on the drier Inland Kaikoura Ranges. Widespread fire broke out in the early Polynesian era and between 750 and 600 years B.P. the Awatere catchment lost most of its forest cover, which was replaced by bracken, grass and scrub. There was a slight recovery of forest and scrub after 600 years B.P. when burning frequency lessened. Increased burning, grazing, and introduction of exotic weeds accompanied the penetration of the region by European pastoralists in the 1860s. The post-1960 era is clearly indicated by the upsurge of Echium vulgare and Pinus spp. The Winterton bog has a finely balanced water budget, and it may have been initiated by changes in the seasonality of rainfall in the mid-Holocene.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
McGlone:1995central,"Pollen diagrams from upland blanket bogs and mire--pool complexes on the southern Garvie Mountains and the Old Man Range, and from a sag pond mire on the slopes of the Kawarau Gorge, record the vegetation history of the last 12 000 years in Central Otago, the driest region of New Zealand. During the late--glacial/early Holocene these subalpine sites supported grassland/shrubland vegetation. Trees or tall scrub were absent. Tree ferns became increasingly common in the early Holocene, most likely as small stands in damp, sheltered locations. At 7500 yr B.P. a coniferous forest of Prumnopitys taxifolia, Dacrycarpus dacrydioides and Podocarpus abruptly replaced the previous grassland communities at lower altitudes, while a coniferous scrub of Phyllocladus alpinus and Halocarpus bidwillii formed the upper treeline. The reafforestation of Central Otago and adjacent regions was completed 2000 years after podocarp--dominant forest began to occupy coastal regions. The delay is attributed to drier climates in the interior of the southern South Island during the early Holocene. From 6000 yr B.P. Nothofagus menziesii began to spread through the higher altitude forest, and shortly after 3000 yr B.P. N. fusca type forest began to replace the previous treeline dominants, Phyllocladus and Halocarpus. Treeline may have risen slightly in the mid to late Holocene. From 600 yr B.P., repeated fires destroyed both lowland and upland forest and tall scrub communities. First bracken, and then grassland, replaced the burnt forest. These fires were a consequence of Maori exploitation of the Otago hinterlands.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
McGlone:1996change,"Long climate records from deep sea sediments and polar ice caps show that the last few million years have been dominated by quasi-regular glacial-interglacial cycles. These cycles are ultimately regulated by fluctuations in high latitude, northern hemisphere, seasonal solar radiation caused by orbital perturbations. Trace gas records from ice cores reveal variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentrations that parallel climate fluctuations. The sensitivity of global temperatures to increasing greenhouse gases (approximately 2°C for a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations), as estimated from palaeoclimate records, is close to that derived from numerical modelling of future greenhouse warming. Comparison of records of past climate states with numerical climatic model simulations show that previous versions of general circulation models (GCMs) have not performed well in Oceania, possibly because of inaccurate sea surface temperatures, a lack of an interactive ocean, and coarse resolution. More recent GCM versions perform better with present climates, and give indications of better performance in modelling past climates. ...

McGlone:1996stewart,"Stewart Island is the southernmost of the three main New Zealand islands, and is largely covered with Dacrydium cupressinum/hardwood forest. Pollen analyses from three Holocene sites and a modern pollen rain survey are presented. Stewart Island had a hardwood forest of Weinmannia racemosa, Metrosideros umbellata, and abundant tree ferns from before 9000 BP to 5500-4500 BP when Dacrydium cupressinum and Prumnopitys ferruginea rose to dominate the forest reducing the abundance of Weinmannia racemosa and greatly restricting Metrosideros umbellata. It is suggested that mild, cloudy climates during the early Holocene may have inhibited regeneration of podocarp trees, and that a change in climatic regime in the mid to late Holocene brought sunnier, less cloudy conditions. Several woody species absent from the island but present on the adjacent mainland (Phyllocladus alpinus, Nothofagus spp., Libocedrus bidwillii) probably never grew there, and their absence is attributed to failure to disperse and the limited time that suitable habitats have been available.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Precipitation in the early Holocene may have been up to 30 percent less than that of the present, and peat accumulation was restricted to topogenous mires. Alpine ombrogenous bogs began growth at ca. 7500 BP. At the same time, forest and tall scrub spread in the adjacent lowlands in response to increasing rainfall, replacing grassland-shrub-lands. Peat accumulation was slow and episodic and declined to very low rates after 3000 BP, probably as a result of cooler winters and drier summers. Low levels of natural fire occurred throughout the Holocene. However, from 750 BP onwards, lowland forest and scrub was severely reduced, subalpine shrubland declined, and snow tussock grassland increased markedly as fires lit by Polynesian hunters swept the region. From A.D. 1850 onwards, European pastoralists introduced sheep and increased the burning of the uplands to improve grazing.

After that date the valley bottom vegetation became increasingly short and open, and the bog ceased growing, probably as a result of increasingly droughty summers. The adjacent hilly country supported a forest/scrub cover of Podocarpus hallii, Phyllocladus alpinus, Halocarpus bidwillii, and small--leaved shrubs. A site in the Mackenzie Basin near Lake Pukaki recorded near total dominance by Phyllocladus alpinus scrub from c. 8000 yr B.P. until 5000 yr B.P. after which time Halocarpus bidwillii, Aciphylla, and grassland became increasingly important in response to drought and local fires. At a third site, again in the Mackenzie Basin, Halocarpus bidwillii formed a complete scrub cover at the time of Maori settlement at about 800--600 yr B.P. but fire then rapidly reduced the scrub to grassland.

From 12 000 to 7000 yr BP, a shrub--grassland dominated under a dry climate, with increasing conifer forest and tall scrub from ca. 9600 yr BP. At 7000 yr BP a dense montane--subalpine low conifer forest established under a moist, cool climatic regime. Between 7000 and 700 yr BP the bog surface was shrubby, tending to be dry but with highly variable surface wetness. The catchment was affected by major fire at least four times between 4000 and 1000 yr BP. Both fire and bog surface wetness may have been linked to ENSO-caused variations in rainfall. Cooler, cloudier winters and disturbance by fire promoted the expansion of the broadleaf tree Nothofagus menziesii between 4000 yr BP and 1300 yr BP at the expense of the previous conifer forest--scrub vegetation. Polynesian fires (ca. 700 yr BP) reduced the vegetation to tussock grassland and bracken. Deforestation did not markedly affect the hydrology of the site.

McGlone:2001origin,"Immediately before human settlement, dense tall podocarp- angiosperm forest dominated the moist Southland and southern coastal Otago districts. Open, discontinuous podocarp-angiosperm forest bordered the central Otago dry interior, extending along the north Otago coast. Grassland was mostly patchy within these woody ecosystems, occurring on limited areas of droughty or low-nutrient soils and wetlands, or temporarily after infrequent fire or other disturbance. Podocarpus hallii, Phyllocladus alpinus and Halocarpus bidwillii, small-leaved and asterad shrubs formed low forest and shrub associations in the semi arid interior, with Nothofagus menziesii prominent in the upper montane-subalpine zone. Substantial grasslands were confined to the alpine zone and dry terraces in intermontane basins. The arrival of the first Maori settlers at c. 800 BP led immediately to widespread burning and near-elimination of the fire-sensitive woody vegetation from all but the wettest districts. Non-Chionochloa grasses (probably species of Poa, Elymus and Festuca) and, in particular, bracken were the first to spread after fire; later, with continued fire, the more slowly spreading Chionochloa tussock grasslands became common. A unique suite of dryland woody ecosystems has thus been replaced with fire-induced grasslands. Recreation of the pre-human vegetation cover from the surviving small remnants is problematical because of the anomalous fire-sensitivity of the indigenous drought-tolerant flora. In the current historically unprecedented fire-prone environment, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is preservation of the status quo.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
McGlone:2004cass,"Lithology, pollen, macrofossils, and stable carbon isotopes from an intermontane basin bog site in southern New Zealand provide a detailed late-glacial and early Holocene vegetation and climate record. Glacial retreat occurred before 17,000 cal yr b.p., and tundra-like grassland--shrubland occupied the basin shortly after. Between 16,500 and 14,600 cal yr b.p., a minor regional expansion of forest patches occurred in response to warming, but the basin remained in shrubland. Forest retreated between 14,600 and 13,600 cal yr b.p., at about the time of the Antarctic Cold Reversal. At 13,600 cal yr b.p., a steady progression from shrubland to tall podocarp forest began as the climate ameliorated. Tall, temperate podocarp trees replaced stress-tolerant shrubs and trees between 12,800 and 11,300 cal yr b.p., indicating sustained warming during the Younger Dryas Chronozone (YDC). Stable isotopes suggest increasing atmospheric humidity from 11,800 to 9300 cal yr b.p.

Seven peat profiles from sea level to the tundra zone provide an elevational transect for pollen and charcoal records spanning the last 500 years. Scrub density was relatively low between 200 and 400 cal yrs BP, possibly due to Little Ice Age cooling, but had recovered by the time Europeans discovered the island in AD 1810. Burning and grazing during a brief farming episode (AD 1895--1931) severely reduced scrub and palatable grasses and forbs. Vegetation recovery is now well advanced following cessation of farming and the later elimination of all feral grazing animals, cats and rats. Climates were cool in the southwest Pacific during the farming period, and since AD 1970 the island has warmed by c. 0·5°C. However, there has been no upwards movement of the scrubline despite vigorous regeneration of scrub at lower altitudes. The island's cloudy, highly oceanic climate appears to offset increasing summer warmth, and scrubline is likely to rise only if clearer and less windy, as well as warmer, summers eventuate.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
McGlone:2009postglacial,"Most New Zealand wetlands formed at or after the end of the last glaciation (c. 18 000 cal yrs BP). Those associated with major rivers and close to the coast tend to be young as erosive processes both destroy and initiate wetlands. However, there is a strong linear trend in initiations since 14 000 cal yrs BP, which suggests that geomorphic processes such as soil deterioration, landslides, sand dune movement and river course changes are constantly adding new, permanent wetlands. Most wetlands began as herbaceous fens but usually transitioned to shrub- or forest-covered bog--fen systems, in particular after the beginning of the Holocene (11 500 cal yrs BP). Raised bogs formed from fens during the late-glacial and early Holocene, when river down-cutting isolated them from groundwater inflow. As climates warmed through the late-glacial and early Holocene, wooded wetlands spread and over 75 percent of lowland peat profiles preserve wood layers. Large basins with high water inflow often contain lakes or lagoons and have maintained herbaceous swamps, whereas those with limited catchments have become almost entirely covered with forest or shrub. Wetlands in drier districts tend to have been initiated during the mid- and late Holocene as the climate cooled and rain-bearing systems penetrated more often. Ombrogenous montane and alpine bogs may have been initiated by the same climate change. Natural fires frequently burnt some wetlands, particularly within the vast bog complexes of the Waikato Basin, but many wetlands record occasional fire episodes. By the time Mâori arrived in the 13th century, about 1 percent of the landscape was covered with some form of wetland and most of that wetland was under woody cover. Mâori firing of the landscape began the process of removing the woody cover, which induced wetter, more herbaceous systems and initiated new wetlands. Deforestation of catchments in drier districts increased water yield that may in turn have created lowland fens and lagoons. European logging, fire and draining destroyed both pristine forested wetlands and fire-transformed systems from the Mâori settlement era. The loss of wetlands is now largely a crisis of continued degradation through draining, weed invasion and fire in already human-altered systems in productive landscapes. Wetland history can help assess values and inform goals for conservation of wetlands, but transformation of the lowland landscape has been so complete that an historically authentic endpoint is unrealistic for most wetlands. The major conservation emphasis should be on larger wetlands that provide a range of ecosystem services.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
McGowan:2012enso,"The Kimberley region of northwest Australia contains one of the World's largest collections of rock art characterised by two distinct art forms; the fine featured anthropomorphic figures of the Gwion Gwion or Bradshaw paintings, and broad stroke Wandjina figures. Luminescence dating of mud wasp nests overlying Gwion Gwion paintings has confirmed an age of at least 17,000 yrs B.P. with the most recent dates for these paintings from around the mid-Holocene (5000 to 7000 yrs B.P.). Radiocarbon dating indicates that the Wandjina rock art then emerged around 3800 to 4000 yrs B.P. following a hiatus of at least 1200 yrs. Here we show that a mid-Holocene ENSO forced collapse of the Australian summer monsoon and ensuing mega-drought spanning approximately 1500 yrs was the likely catalyst of this change in rock art. The severity of the drought we believe was enhanced through positive feedbacks triggered by change in land surface condition and increased aerosol loading of the atmosphere leading to a weakening or failure of monsoon rains. This confirms that pre-historic aboriginal cultures experienced catastrophic upheaval due to rapid natural climate variability and that current abundant seasonal water supplies may fail again if significant change in ENSO occurs.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

McIntosh:2009erosion,"The establishment of a chronology of landscape-forming events in lowland and mid-altitude Tasmania, essential for assessing the relative importance of climatic and human influences on erosion, and for assessing present erosion risk, has been limited by the small number of ages obtained and limitations of dating methods. In this paper we critically assess previous Tasmanian studies, list published radiocarbon ages considered to be dependable, present new radiocarbon and thermoluminescence (TL) ages for 25 sites around Tasmania, and consider the evidence for the hypotheses that erosion processes at low and mid altitudes have been: (1) purely climatically controlled; and (2) influenced both by climatic and anthropogenic (increased fire frequency) effects. A total of 94 dependable finite ages (calibrated for radiocarbon and 'as measured' for TL and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) determinations) are listed for deposits comprising dunes, colluvium, alluvium and loess-like aeolian deposits. Two fall in the >100ka period, 15 fall in the period 65-35ka, and 77 fall in the period 35-0.3ka. There was a sustained increase in erosion recorded in the period 35-15ka, as reflected by a greater number of dated aeolian deposits during this period. We considered three possible biases that may have affected the age distribution obtained: the limitations of radiocarbon dating, sampling bias, and preservation bias. Sampling bias may have favoured more recent dune strata, but radiocarbon dating and preservation biases are unlikely to have significantly distorted the age distribution obtained. Long but intermittent aeolian deposition is recorded at two sites (Southwood B; c. 59-28ka and Dunlin Dune; c. 29-14ka) but there is no evidence of regional loess deposits such as found in New Zealand. The timing of increased erosion in Tasmania between 35 and 30ka approximately coincides with the intermittent ten-fold increase of dust accumulation between 33 and 30ka in the Antarctic Dome C ice core. The absence of widespread erosion before 35ka, the abrupt increase of erosion around this time, the frequent association of erosion products with charcoal, the arrival of people in Tasmania at c. 40cal ka, and the known use of fires by Aborigines to maintain areas of non-climax vegetation suggest that ecosystem disturbance by anthropogenic fires, in a drier climate than that presently prevailing, may have contributed to erosion in lowland and mid-altitude Tasmania after 35ka. Thus the Tasmanian erosion record provides circumstantial support for the proposition that human dispersal in southeast Australia was accompanied by significant ecological change.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McIntosh:2012extraglacial,"Many Tasmanian deposits previously described as 'periglacial' have been described in more detail, re-interpreted and dated. We suggest that 'periglacial' has little meaning when applied locally and the term 'relict cold-climate deposits' is more appropriate. In this paper we examine the origin and age of relict cold-climate slope deposits, fan alluvium and aeolian sediments in Tasmania, and infer the conditions under which they accumulated. Fan alluvium dating from the penultimate Glacial (OIS 6) and capped by a prominent palaeosol deduced to date to the Last Interglacial (OIS 5e) is present at Woodstock, south of Hobart. Many fan deposits formed before 40ka or in a period c. 30-23ka; only a few deposits date to the Last Glacial Maximum in Tasmania, which is defined as spanning the period 23.5-17.5ka. Slope deposits indicate widespread instability down to present-day sea level throughout the Last Glacial, probably as a result of freeze-thaw in a sparsely vegetated landscape. Layered fine gravel and coarse sand colluvial deposits resembling grèzes litées, produced both by dry deposition and by the action of water, are locally common where jointed siltstone bedrock outcrops. These deposits occur from altitudes of 500m to near sea level and also in caves and must have formed under sparse vegetation cover, probably by freeze-thaw in extremely dry conditions. They have been radiocarbon dated from 35 to 17.5cal. ka. Relict dunes and sandsheets are widespread at the margin of the Bassian Plain that once provided a land bridge between Tasmania and the mainland. They are also found in western Tasmania and in areas of inland southern Tasmania that now support wet eucalypt forest and rainforest and receive mean annual rainfall >1500mm. In the south they have been dated >87.5-19ka and attest to a long period of semi-arid climate in an area extending well to the west and south of the present semiarid zone. We deduce that during most of the Last Glacial anticyclones dominated Tasmania's climate and rain-bearing depressions generally passed south of the land mass. However in the east prominent palaeosols in aeolian deposits, dated between 26.4ka and 16ka at different locations, and palaeosols with morphology indicating formation under humid conditions, indicate periods of wetter climate in eastern Tasmania during or close to the LGM, deduced to be the result of easterlies associated with near-coastal depressions in the western Tasman Sea. Such easterlies may also be responsible for short Last Glacial wet periods noted at mainland coastal sites. A plot of ages of all dated deposits reveals an increase of erosion and deposition between 35 and 20ka, and greater prevalence of aeolian deposits in the 35-15ka period than earlier in the Last Glacial. There are two possible explanations for this pattern: (1) that aeolian activity increased as the result of climatic effects (e.g. increased windiness); or (2) that shrubland biomass increased after the megafauna were hunted to extinction following human arrival c. 40ka, causing increased fire frequency, and in the cold dry climate of the late Last Glacial such fires caused increased erosion and increased aeolian accumulation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

McKenzie:1997chapple,"A well-dated pollen record from Chapple Vale in the north of the Otway region provides a detailed history of vegetation and environments through the last c. 7000 years. From the commencement of the record, a stand of cool temperate rainforest, dominated by Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst., grew on or around the site and was surrounded by eucalypt-dominated tall open forest. Between c. 5200 and 4600 years BP (before present), the rainforest declined and tall open forest predominated. Some time after 4400 years BP there was a major and consistent increase in charcoal values, suggesting an increase in burning, the progressive development of scrub--heath vegetation on site and the replacement of tall open forest vegetation by eucalypt woodland surrounding the site. The fossil evidence for N. cunninghamii on the site and its present restriction to wetter areas and gullies of the Otway Ranges indicate, from the application of the present bioclimatic range of the species, a mean annual temperature and winter temperatures that were c. 1°C cooler than present, and summer temperatures that were possibly slightly cooler than present, together with a much higher effective precipitation from the commencement of the record until c. 4600 years BP. These climatic estimates are in accord with those derived from a similar study of changing distributions of N. cunninghamii in the Central Highlands of lower mean annual and cooler summer temperatures and higher effective precipitation over this time span. However, for winter, the evidence is equivocal. While the Otway estimates suggest lower temperatures, the Central Highlands findings show slightly higher temperatures. Taking into account additional present-day records for N. cunninghamii, it is likely that the Otway estimates are the most reliable.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
McKenzie:1997highlandsi,"The late Quaternary vegetation communities of the south-central highlands of Victoria are reconstructed from analyses of pollen and charcoal, and associated environmental conditions derived from the record of Nothofagus cunninghamii and alpine and sclerophyll taxa preserved in four subalpine Sphagnum bogs. The highest site occurs amid Eucalyptus paucifiora woodland, the two intermediate sites are surrounded by Eucalyptus delegatensis forest and the lowest by a mixed forest ofE. delegatensis/Eucalyptus regnans. Small pockets of N. cunninghamii occur within the eucalypt forests, and in close proximity to all four sites. Around 32 000 BP the vegetation consisted of a mosaic of alpine feldmark and herbfield, with small scattered groves of Nothofagus and Eucalyptus well below 1100 m. Summer temperatures were probably 5°C lower than present with lowest values, probably 7° to 8°C below present, possibly between 17 000 and 13 500 BP, at which time alpine communities reached their greatest extent and much of the Central Highlands was treeless. After ca 13 500 BP herbaceous alpine taxa disappeared and there was an associated movement upslope of Nothofagus and tall open forest taxa to their maximum post-glacial extent, as temperatures and effective precipitation increased, ca 6000 BP. The retraction of cool temperate rainforest and wet sclerophyll or tall open forest towards present day values indicates lower effective precipitation, generally rising temperatures and increased fire hazard. More recently, European activities have increased the stress on the remaining forests. The study of four sites has demonstrated the importance of analysing a number of sites within a given area in order to overcome the limitations imposed by sites which were sub-optimal due to one or more factors including poor preservation, problems of dating, variable sedimentation rates, and the influence of streams which flow close to all sites. While the local environment varies between sites, and some vegetation changes are successional, this study shows that the local records complement one another, to some extent reinforcing the regional picture of vegetation and environmental change.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
McKenzie:2000wyelangta,"This paper presents the first long Quaternary palynological record from the Otway region of Victoria, an area which is biogeographically important in that it is an outlier of the southeastern highlands containing distinctive forest vegetation with great similarities to the island of Tasmania. The record is derived from a small remnant patch of cool temperate rainforest dominated by Nothofagus cunninghamii surrounded by tall open eucalypt forest. Three clear phases are identified: an older rainforest phase dated to beyond 40,000 years BP which probably represents the latter part of Oxygen Isotope Stage 5; a phase of more open vegetation which covers at least part of the last glacial period; and a younger rainforest phase of Holocene age. The record is significant in providing refinements to late Quaternary climatic estimates from southeastern Australia utilising the climatic profiles of key rainforest taxa, and in indicating the likely presence and nature of a glacial rainforest 'refugium'. The occurrence of a major rain forest tree, Phyllocladus, during the early forest phase and of the subalpine taxon Gunnera, during the last glacial period, taxa now restricted to Tasmania, demonstrates an even greater biogeographic link to this island in the recent past. Their extinction on the mainland is consistent with the general demise of cool temperate taxa with close Gondwanan affinities on the Australian mainland through the Late Cenozoic period. Their late disappearance contributes to the growing list of mainland extinctions of ancient and geographically interesting taxa adding weight to the proposal that Aboriginal burning has had a substantial impact on the Australian landscape during the last glacial cycle.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
McKenzie:2002highlandsii,"The late Quaternary vegetation communities of the south-central highlands of Victoria are constructed from analyses of pollen and charcoal, and macroscopic plant remains preserved in Sphagnum bogs. The sites, located in eucalypt forest or woodland, form an altitudinal sequence with the component Eucalyptus species varying with altitude and with small pockets of Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst. in close proximity to the higher sites. The record from the sites above 900 m covers the last 32 000 years, and the record from the lower sites extends from at least 12 000 BP. Around 32 000 BP the region was predominantly covered by a mosaic of alpine feldmark and herbfield, with small patches of Eucalyptus and Nothofagus woodland close to sea level when summer temperatures were probably 5°C lower than present. Lowest values, probably 7°--8°C below present, occurred between 19 800 and 16 900 BP, when alpine communities were most widespread and much of the Central Highlands was treeless. Around 12 000 BP alpine taxa disappeared or were greatly reduced, first at the lower sites. There was an associated rise in the treeline with the movement upslope of Nothofagus and eucalypt forest as a result of a general increase in temperature and probably effective precipitation. By 6000 BP wet eucalypt forest and Nothofagus reached their maximum postglacial extent at all sites, possibly related to a further increase in temperature, at least 2°C lower than present, and higher effective precipitation. A continuing increase in temperature, or an increase in continentality, and a decrease in effective precipitation led to increased fire hazard and retraction of rainforest and wet sclerophyll or tall open forest toward present-day values. Nothofagus disappeared from the sites below 900 m. The activities of humans pose further threats to remaining forest communities. The record of vegetation and environmental change derived from the local and regional picture from eight sites reinforces and complements that from the individual sites. For example, combining the records overcomes to some extent taphonomic problems such as the effect of streams that flow close to all sites, and other limitations including problems of dating, poor preservation and variable sedimentation rates.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

The record was obtained from a small, remnant, riverine patch of cool temperate rainforest dominated by the southern beech species, Nothofagus cunninghamii, and surrounded by tall open eucalypt forest. The present nature and extent of forest vegetation had been established by the beginning of the record and, in line with other records from southeastern Australia, there is evidence for higher precipitation than today during the mid-Holocene from a slight expansion of rainforest and increased diversity of tall open forest vegetation. From 4300 years ago, forest vegetation around the site becomes more open allowing the establishment of herbaceous swamp taxa. This development is attributed to relative stability of the site, with a reduction in stream water flow. A major feature of the record is the presence of pollen from the southern conifers Podocarpus, Phyllocladus and Dacrycarpus whose parent plants were important components of Victorian rainforest vegetation during the Tertiary period but no longer grow in the Otway region. Although it is considered that these plants were unlikely to have been present in the Holocene, it is proposed it is most likely that they survived within the region until the late Quaternary, possibly until the arrival of Aboriginal people.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

In particular, my research focuses upon the methodological problem of systemic site interaction and the more general theoretical issue of human response to spatial variation in resource structure. The study is based upon the results of surveys (site and non-site) and excavations. It also represents Stage 2 of the Cooloola Region Archaeological Project (CRAP). Two major chronological phases are identified at Cooloola, a Recent and an Early Phase. Recent Phase sites (ca. 1000-100 BP) are represented by a complex of shell middens located up to 10km inland from the present shoreline. These sites demonstrate highly specialized exploitation of marine shellfish and fish species. Recent Phase stone artefact assemblages are dominated by local raw materials and bevel-edged tools. Early Phase sites (ca. 5500-3000 BP) are generally represented by large stone artefact scatters devoid of faunal remains. These stone artefact assemblages are dominated by exotic raw materials and a greater variety of formal implement types (e.g. bevel-edged tools, backed blades, bifacial points). Recent Phase middens are generally restricted to the estuarine resource-rich southern and northern parts of Cooloola. These areas not only exhibit all of the recorded ceremonial/ritual (e.g. ‘bora ring‘, burial) sites at Cooloola, but also correspond to the locations of historically-recorded Aboriginal groups and activities during the 19th century. I argue that such site patterning demonstrates the potential effects of resource productivity upon the spatial organization of Aboriginal social, ceremonial and subsistence activities. A detailed land-use model, consisting of eastern (oceanic) and western (estuarine) settlement-subsistence sub-systems, is generated for northern midden sites. The eastern settlement-subsistence sub-system largely consists of ‘home bases‘ located along Teewah Beach with associated ephemeral rainforest and swamp plant food foraging camps located on the adjacent sandmass. The western settlement-subsistence sub-system largely consists of ‘home bases‘ located along Tin Can Bay with associated ephemeral swamp plant food foraging camps located across the adjacent ‘swamp zone‘. ...

The open site yielded a stone artefact sequence dated from 5531 BP to 316 BP (calibrated), with fauna1 remains (shellfish and fish) appearing at ca 900 BP. Major inferences drawn from the excavations are: 1. despite a human presence in southeast Queensland for at least 20,000 years, ca 5500 BP marks the first major human occupation of Coolda. Such a pattern resulted from the localised adaptation of an existing coastal settlement-subsistence system which had been flowing the transgressing coastline westwards until its relative stabilisation at ca 6000 BP; 2. fishing may have been of equal or greater significance during the mid-Holocene compared to the last 1000 years; 3. the distinctive southeast Queensland artefact type, bevel-edged tool (‘bevelled pounder‘) has an antiquity of at least between 5000 BP and 4000 BP, not ca 1500 BP as previously thought, thus making it one of the oldest, continuously used plant food processing tool types known in Australia; 4. increased relative use of local resources (shellfish and stone) across Codoola and other parts of coastal southeast Queensland during the last ca 1000 years corresponds to the development of regionally isolated settlement-subsistence systems and associated societal entities similar to those recorded historically; and 5. while most of these conclusions complement Hall and Hiscock’s (1988) model of cultural change for southeast Queensland, I argue that their use of intrinsic population increase as a prime mover is theoretically problematic.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Extensive use of dugong bones in ritual sites has important implications for the extent to which ‘secular‘ midden deposits are representative of Islander subsistence practices.

The presence of bipolar micro-cores less than 10mm in length reveals extreme reduction of quartz, possibly for manufacture of small skin cutting tools. While recent research indicates an antiquity of at least 4000 years for marine specialists in Torres Strait, Dauan 4 follows a suite of sites across the Strait demonstrating major cultural changes taking place within the last 600-800 years. These changes herald the emergence of ethnographically-known social arrangements marked by a rapid phase of site establishment and intensified site use consistent with population increase. Paralleling these changes was the appearance of new ritual sites linked spiritually to seascapes such as dugong bone arrangements, stone arrangements and shell arrangements.

McNiven:2006mask,"Excavations at Mask Cave on the sacred islet of Pulu off Mabuyag in the central west of Zenadh Kes (Torres Strait) reveal four occupational phases: Phase 1 (2900-3800 years ago), Phase 2 (2100-2600 years ago), Phase 3 (1500-1700 years ago) and Phase 4 (last 1500 years). Faunal remains indicate marine specialization (turtle and fish) during all phases. Petrographic analysis of sherds of finely made red-slipped pottery dating back 2400-2600 years reveals a unique fabric in terms of current understandings of Oceanic ceramic technologies. Mineral inclusions are consistent with local geology suggesting local manufacture and the existence of Indigenous Australia's first pottery tradition. Pre-ceramic Phase 1 is associated with demographic expansions across the western islands of Zenadh Kes by local populations of marine-based hunter-gatherers who were primarily Aboriginal language speakers. Phase 2 is associated with the immigration of Papuan maritime, horticultural and pottery-making peoples to the eastern and western islands of Zenadh Kes commencing 2600 years ago. Australian then Papuan settlement expansions across the western islands of Zenadh Kes explain why the local Western-Central Language has an Aboriginal base with a Papuan overlay. First colonization of the eastern islands by Papuans explains why the local Meriam Mìr language is Papuan. Early red-slipped pottery in Zenadh Kes is linked to southern coastal Papuan pottery traditions that are reassessed to have a comparable 2600 year antiquity. Papuan settlement of the southern Papuan coast and Zenadh Kes was an extension of the post-Lapita settlement of the Pacific, an event memorialized in part by Torres Strait Islander oral tradition.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McNiven:2008dabangai,"Dugongs (Dugong dugon) are a key food item and a totemic animal with major spiritual significance for Torres Strait Islanders of northeastern Australia. These marine mammals are officially classed vulnerable to extinction which has placed hunters under considerable internal (cultural) and external (bureaucratic) pressure to lower hunting rates dramatically to sustainable levels. But did Torres Strait Islanders hunt dugongs at much lower rates in the pre-colonial past? Excavation of a ritual dugong bone mound on Mabuyag island revealed the remains of 10,000-11,000 dugongs hunted between c. 1600 and c. 1900AD. The translated hunting rate of 33-37 dugongs per year is surprisingly high and challenging as this single site represents one-third of what conservation biologists argue is the current mean sustainable hunting rate for the entire Torres Strait archipelago. These data suggest that dugong abundance was much higher in the pre-colonial past and that current hunting rates are uncharacteristically unsustainable primarily due to an unprecedented dugong population crash and not increased post-contact hunting rates.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The diverse faunal assemblage demonstrates procurement of turtle, dugong, shellfish, fish, shark and ray from mangrove, reef and open water environments. Apart from a characteristic flaked quartz technology, the site contains shell body adornments. Establishment of Tigershark Rockshelter reveals increasing preference for shoreline settlements possibly for enhanced intervisibility, intimacy and liminality between newlyconceptualised territorial land- and seascapes. Intensified occupation 500-700 years ago matches concomitant demographic expansions across the region. As local settlement patterns focused on large open village sites 500 years ago, Tigershark Rockshelter became obsolete and was abandoned. These settlement reconfigurations were part of broader social transformations that eventually saw the status of Pulu change from a residential to a ceremonial and sacred place.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McNiven:2008zenadh,"This collection makes a substantial contribution to several highly topical areas of archaeological inquiry. Many of the papers present new and innovative research into the processes of maritime colonisation, processes that affect archaeological contexts from islands to continents. Others shift focus from process to the archaeology of maritime places from the Bering to the Torres Straits, providing highly detailed discussions of how living by and with the sea is woven into all elements of human life from subsistence to trade and to ritual. Of equal importance are more abstract discussions of islands as natural places refashioned by human occupation, either through the introduction of new organisms or new systems of production and consumption. These transformation stories gain further texture (and variety) through close examinations of some of the more significant consequences of colonisation and migration, particularly the creation of new cultural identities.

A series of AMS 14C dates indicate that most of the ochres and all pieces of facetted ochre were deposited between 1200 and 1400 years ago. Located in a moist tropical environment where the potential for erosion and bioturbation is high, the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit was tested by micromorphological analysis of sediments. Assessment of vertical changes in the size of stone artefacts and sediment particle sizes suggest strongly that this restricted timeframe for ochre use is reliable and not a taphonomic illusion created by post-depositional disturbance. These in situ ochres are associated with an early phase of painting at the site and represent the oldest dates currently available for Torres Strait rock art.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

As a result of this dynamic relationship, ceremonial sites and social groups exhibit ever-emergent properties as long-term works-in-progress. Ceremonial kod sites featuring shrines of trumpet shells and dugong bones were central to the communal ritual life of Torres Strait Islanders. Continuously formed over the generations by ritual additions, these shrines were linked to ongoing maintenance, legitimization and cohesion of totemic clans and moieties that formed the structural basis of island communities. As such, understanding the history of kod sites provides an opportunity to investigate the historical emergence of ethnographically-known social groups in Torres Strait. This mutual emergence is investigated archaeologically at the kod on Pulu islet which is owned and operated by the Goemulgal people of nearby Mabuyag island. Multiple radiocarbon dates from shell and bone shrines and an underlying village midden indicate that the kod, and by association the Goemulgal and their totemic clan and moiety system, emerged over the past 400 years. Aided by local oral history and ethnography, it is argued further that establishment of the kod saw the status of Pulu change from a residential to a ceremonial and sacred place.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Epe Amoho is the largest hunting camp rockshelter used by the Himaiyu clan (Rumu people) of the Kikori River region, southern Papua New Guinea. Contemporary ethnographic information indicates dry season site use with subsistence practices directed towards riverine fishing and shellfishing, mammal hunting and gardening in the surrounding rainforest. But how long has the site been used and when in the past did activities start to resemble those known ethnographically? Archaeological excavations revealed three pulses of activity: Recent Phase (0-500 cal BP), Middle Phase (900-1200 cal BP) and Early Phase (2500-2850 cal BP). Pollen data reveal increasing rainforest disturbance by people through time. While the best match between ethnographic and archaeological practices occurs during the Recent Phase, selected aspects of Rumu subsistence extend back to the Early Phase. As the temporal depth of ethnographically-known practices differs between archaeological sites, a complex picture emerges where Rumu cultural practices unfolded at differing points in time and space over a period of at least 3000 years.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We document the first known occurrence of Lapita peoples on the New Guinea mainland. The new Lapita sites date from 2900 to 2500 cal BP and represent a newly-discovered migratory arm of Lapita expansions that moved westwards along the southern New Guinea coast towards Australia. These marine specialists ate shellfish, fish and marine turtles along the Papua New Guinea mainland coast, reflecting subsistence continuities with local pre-Lapita peoples dating back to 4200 cal BP.

Recent fine-grained excavation and comprehensive AMS dating and analysis of channel in-fill sediments associated with an elaborate freshwater fishtrap complex at Lake Condah, western Victoria, yields reliable insights into the phased construction and use of the feature. An early phase of basalt bedrock removal to create a bifurcated channel was subsequently in-filled with flood sediments incorporating stone artefacts and charcoal dated to c.6600 cal BP. After a hiatus, basalt blocks were added to the sides of the channel to create multi-tiered walls within the past 600–800 years.

Excavations on Collins, Otterbourne and High Peak Islands, located up to 40 km from the mainland, reveal evidence of offshore voyaging and marine specialisation in the Shoalwater Bay region for at least 5200 years. A time lag of up to 3000 years between island formation and systematic island use may reflect delayed development of key marine resources. Expansion of island use commencing around 3000–3500 years ago is linked to population increases sustained by synchronous increases in marine resources. Occupational hiatuses variously between 1000 and 3000 years ago are associated with increased ENSO activity. Intensified island use within the past 1000 years is primarily a social phenomenon associated with continuing demographic pressures and the development of more coastally and marine-focused mainland groups, with settlement patterns increasingly encompassing adjacent islands. The viability of risky offshore canoe voyaging was underwritten by two key high-return subsistence pursuits – hunting green turtles and collecting turtle eggs. In addition to subsistence and quartz quarrying, a key motivation for island visitation may have been socially restricted (e.g. ceremonial) practices.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
McNiven:2015fishtraps,"Critics point out that a weakness of Lourandos’ ‘intensification’ paradigm for southwestern Victoria is a lack of dates for iconic fish traps of the Lake Condah region. McNiven et al. (2012) detailed excavations at Muldoons Trap Complex at Lake Condah in Gunditjmara Country, where charcoal recovered from channel infill sediments indicated initial construction at least 6600 cal. BP, making the site one of the world’s oldest known fish traps. Channel excavations also revealed the addition of basalt block walls dating to ca 600–800 cal. BP. Subsequent excavations at a second location at Muldoons demonstrate that a barrier/dam feature associated with artificial ponding of flood waters and containment of eels was added to the site complex ca 300–500 cal. BP and possibly elaborated in the nineteenth century. These results show that Muldoons Trap Complex underwent phased redevelopment and major elaboration over the past 800 years. This redevelopment followed little or no activity during the preceding 4000 years, which we argue reflected drier climatic conditions and the inability of flood waters to reach the site. Use of the site complex 5400–6600 and <800 years ago took advantage of regional increases in effective precipitation and lake water levels. Redevelopment of Muldoons Trap Complex within the past 800 years coincided with increased use of occupation sites across the broader region.

McNiven:2015goemu,"Goemu village site on Mabuyag features one of the largest midden deposits recorded in Torres Strait. Following pioneering mapping and excavations of the site by archaeologists from University College London (UCL) in 1985, we document in detail results of follow-up excavations undertaken at two linear mounded midden deposits by archaeologists from Monash University in 2005. Comprehensive radiocarbon dating indicates Square A mound formed c.350-450 cal BP while Square B mound formed c.950-1,000 cal BP. Both mounds reveal a subsistence focus on dugong and turtle hunting supplemented by fishing and shellfishing from adjacent intertidal reef flats and mangrove forests. Lower densities of dugong bone in Square A probably reflect concomitant deposition of dugong bones in specialised ritual bone mounds. Inclusion of dog teeth, teeth extracted from children post-mortem and high density surface concentrations of bottle glass fragments in Square B indicate ritualised deposition before and after European contact. Other material culture includes pearl shell scrapers and ground clam shell adornments. Charcoal underlying midden deposits suggests pre-village landscape firing while land snails within midden deposits suggest shade trees once occurred across the now fire-induced, anthropogenic grasslands of Goemu. Intensified use of Goemu within the past 500 years parallels intensified village occupation on nearby Pulu islet, thus revealing the complementary social history of settlement sites across Goemulgaw territory.",2022-09-13 20:46:18.512 +0200,2022-09-13 20:46:18.512 +0200

McPherson:2014lapstone,"Identifying the influence of neotectonics on the morphology of elevated passive margins is complicated in that major morpho-structural patterns might plausibly be explained by processes related to late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic rifting and/or differential erosion induced by Cenozoic epeirogenic uplift. The proportional contribution of each process can vary from continent to continent, and potentially even within the same passive margin. In the passive margin setting of the southeast Australian highlands the documented occurrence of neotectonic deformation is rare, and accordingly its role in landscape evolution is difficult to establish. The results of investigations within the Lapstone Structural Complex, which forms the eastern range front of the Blue Mountains Plateau, provide evidence for two periods of Cenozoic neotectonic uplift in this part of the highlands. The first, demonstrated by seismic and structural evidence, is suggested to have occurred in the Paleogene, and is thus unrelated to Cretaceous rifting. The second period, demonstrated by evidence from the Kurrajong Fault (presented herein) suggests that uplift occurred in both the Mio-Pliocene and the Middle Pleistocene. The cumulative Neogene and younger uplift of ~15 m determined for the Kurrajong Fault is less than 10% of the 130 m of total measured throw across the fault. The apparently minor contribution of neotectonism to the current elevation of the Blue Mountains Plateau supports a predominantly erosional exhumation origin for the topographic relief at the plateau's eastern edge. This finding contrasts with evidence from fault complexes associated with similar topographic relief elsewhere in the south-eastern highlands, indicating that present-day topography cannot be directly related to relief generated by Neogene and younger uplift, even from relatively closely-spaced (< 150 km) structures within the same passive margin. These findings have implications for understanding the spatio-temporal variability of post-rift faulting in continental passive margin settings and the evolution of landscapes therein.

McPhillips:2013cordillera,"The landscape response to climate change is frequently investigated with models because natural experiments on geologic timescales are rare. In Quebrada Veladera, in the western Andes Mountains, the formation of alluvial terraces during periods of high precipitation presents opportunities for such an experiment. We compare drainage‐average erosion rates during Pleistocene terrace deposition with Holocene rates, using cosmogenic 10Be samples for seven pairs of quartz sand taken from the trunk and tributaries of Quebrada Veladera and adjacent terraces. Each pair consists of sediment collected from the modern channel and excavated from an adjacent fill terrace. The terrace fill was deposited at ~16 ka and preserved an isotopic record of paleoerosion rates in the Late Pleistocene. Modern sands yield 10Be concentrations between 1.68 × 105 and 2.28 × 105 atoms/g, corresponding to Holocene erosion rates between 43 ± 3 and 58 ± 4 mm/kyr. The 10Be concentrations in terrace sands range from 9.46 × 104 to 3.73 × 105 atoms/g, corresponding to paleoerosion rates from 27 ± 2 to 103 ± 8 mm/kyr. Smaller, upstream tributaries show a substantial decline in erosion rate following the transition from a wet to dry climate, but larger drainage areas show no change. We interpret this trend to indicate that the wetter climate drove landscape dissection, which ceased with the return to dry conditions. As channel heads propagated upslope, erosion accelerated in low‐order drainages before higher‐order ones. This contrast disappeared when the drainage network ceased to expand; at that point, erosion rates became spatially uniform, consistent with the uniformity of modern hillslope gradients.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

McWethy:2009fires,"In most parts of the world where people have colonized and modified their landscapes for several millennia or more, it is often difficult to discriminate anthropogenic burning from natural fire regimes that are linked to climate regimes. New Zealand provides a unique setting for identifying human influence on fire occurrence because it was settled recently (c. AD 1280) at a time when climates are considered to be similar to today. Late-Holocene pollen and charcoal records from New Zealand provide striking evidence for initial Polynesian (Māori) arrival being strongly associated with widespread burning and loss of native forest. The duration of initial forest clearance and the spatial pattern of burning that led to this transformation are still poorly understood. We present high-resolution charcoal and pollen analyses of sediment cores from five lakes, located on the deforested eastern side of the Southern Alps. These records document the local fire history of the last 1000 years and the response of vegetation and watersheds to burning. Our results suggest that one to several high-severity fires occurred within a few decades of initial Māori arrival, and this 'Initial Burning Period' (IBP) resulted in the majority of forest loss and erosion. Changes in sedimentation rates, soil chemistry and magnetic susceptibility occurred simultaneously with the first fires at some sites, and marked the end of the IBP at others, suggesting substantial and rapid alteration of watershed vegetation, soil and biochemistry. Timing of the beginning of the IBP varied across sites but the duration of this period was brief (decades to a century). Our results suggest that Māori burning of native forests was deliberate and systematic. These forests had no previous history of fire and thus showed little resilience to the introduction of a new disturbance.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

In the South Island of New Zealand, Polynesians (Māori), who arrived 700–800 calibrated years (cal y) ago, and then Europeans, who settled ∼150 cal y ago, used fire as a tool for forest clearance, but the structure and environmental consequences of these fires are poorly understood. High-resolution charcoal and pollen records from 16 lakes were analyzed to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history of the last 1,000 y. Diatom, chironomid, and element concentration data were examined to identify disturbance-related limnobiotic and biogeochemical changes within burned watersheds. At most sites, several high-severity fire events occurred within the first two centuries of Māori arrival and were often accompanied by a transformation in vegetation, slope stability, and lake chemistry. ...

McWethy:2014transitions,"Human-caused forest transitions are documented worldwide, especially during periods when land use by dense agriculturally-based populations intensified. However, the rate at which prehistoric human activities led to permanent deforestation is poorly resolved. In the South Island, New Zealand, the arrival of Polynesians c. 750 years ago resulted in dramatic forest loss and conversion of nearly half of native forests to open vegetation. This transformation, termed the Initial Burning Period, is documented in pollen and charcoal records, but its speed has been poorly constrained. High-resolution chronologies developed with a series of AMS radiocarbon dates from two lake sediment cores suggest the shift from forest to shrubland occurred within decades rather than centuries at drier sites. We examine two sites representing extreme examples of the magnitude of human impacts: a drier site that was inherently more vulnerable to human-set fires and a wetter, less burnable site. The astonishing rate of deforestation at the hands of small transient populations resulted from the intrinsic vulnerability of the native flora to fire and from positive feedbacks in post-fire vegetation recovery that increased landscape flammability. ...

Mearce:2017himalaya,"Geodetic models suggest that much of the convergence across the Himalaya (~20 mm yr-1) is taken up on the Main Himalayan Thrust, the main decollement beneath the Himalayan orogenic wedge. In Central Nepal and the majority of Northwest India, several geomorphic, geophysical and seismological datasets indicate that this decollement has a mid-crustal ramp that continues uninterrupted for hundreds of kilometers along strike from Nepal in the east to Uttarakhand in the west. In this study, I use spatial analyses of elevation, relief, channel steepness indices, and basin-wide erosion rates from cosmogenic 10Be concentrations to outline a potential large-scale change in the active fault configuration between the Main Himalayan Thrust and Main Boundary Thrust near longitude 77°E in the Northwestern Indian Himalaya. The physiography in the areas to the east of 77oE appears similar to that observed along much of the Himalaya where topographic relief, erosion rates, and river channel steepness (ksn <200) remain relatively low in the areas to the south of a line known as the Physiographic Transition2. North of the Physiographic Transition2, these metrics increase sharply within a 30-km zone due to higher rock uplift rates above a mid-crustal ramp on the decollement or an unidentified out-of-sequence thrust fault that soles to the decollement. Either of these models are perceivable with a duplex growing by underplating of the Indian plate into the Himalayan orogenic wedge contributing to higher rock uplift rates north of the Physiographic Transition2. To the west of 77oE, however, the landscape morphology indicates the Main Boundary Thrust makes a northward bend coinciding with the along-strike termination of the Physiographic Transition2 and an arc-perpendicular Bouguer gravity anomaly reflecting a trough on the Indian plate near longitude 77°E. These data suggest that the Main Boundary Thrust merges along strike with the ramp or with an emergent fault soling into the Main Himalayan Thrust at this location, potentially marking a significant change in tectonic configuration along the Himalayan arc.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Meehan:1975phd,"This thesis is about the role of shellfish in the total diet of a group of coastal hunters and gatherers. The shell gathering activities of the Anbara, a group of Gidjingali-speaking Australian Aborigines living around the mouth of the Blyth River in Arnhem Land during 1972-3, is described in detailed quantitative terms. Reasons for choosing this topic are discussed in Chapter 1 where attention is drawn to the contrast between the abundance of shell midden deposits in the archaeological record and the paucity of shell gathering studies amongst contemporary hunters and gatherers. The Gidjingali are introduced in Chapters 2 and 3 in which an account of their culture, history and present situation is given, together with a description of the major features of their hunting life during 1972-3. Fieldwork conditions and methods are discussed in Chapter 4. Chapters 5 to 9 contain data about the shellfish gathering that occurred during 1972-3. Chapter 5 describes Gidjingali systems of classification that incorporate shellfish taxa; while Chapter 6 elucidates the major patterns of shellfish predation. A detailed ethnographic background for this quantitative data is provided in Chapter 7, where the collection, cooking and disposal of shellfish are described. The performances of individual gatherers are presented in Chapter 8 and the conclusions are compared with those from other similar studies.

Memmott:2006gulf,"This paper presents a set of hypotheses to explain the cultural differences between Aboriginal people of the North and South Wellesley Islands, Gulf of Carpentaria and to characterise the relative degree and nature of their isolation and cultural change over a 10,000-year time-scale. This opportunity to study parallelisms and divergences in the cultural and demographic histories of fisher-hunter-gatherers arises from the comparison of three distinct cultural groupings: (a) the Ganggalida of the mainland, (b) the Lardil and Yangkaal of the North Wellesley Islands, and (c) the Kaiadilt of the South Wellesley Islands. Despite occupying similar island environments and despite their languages being as closely related as for example, the West Germanic languages, there are some major differences in cultural, economic and social organization as well as striking genetic differences between the North and South Wellesley populations.

Meyer:2008rhenish,"We determined erosion rates on timescales of 101–104 years for two catchments in the northeastern Rhenish Massif, in order to unravel the Quaternary landscape evolution in a Variscan mountain range typical of central Europe. Spatially averaged erosion rates derived from in situ produced 10Be concentrations in stream sediment of the Aabach and Möhne watersheds range from 47 ± 6 to 65 ± 14 mm/ka and integrate over the last 9–13 ka. These erosion rates are similar to local rates of river incision and rock uplift in the Quaternary and to average denudation rates since the Mesozoic derived from fission track data. This suggests that rock uplift is balanced by denudation, i.e., the landscape is in a steady state. Short-term erosion rates were derived from suspended and dissolved river loads subsequent to (1) correcting for atmospheric and anthropogenic inputs, (2) establishing calibration curves that relate the amount of suspended load to discharge, and (3) estimating the amount of bedload. The resulting solid mass fluxes (suspended and bedload) agree with those derived from the sediment volume trapped in three reservoirs. However, resulting geogenic short-term erosion rates range from 9 to 25 mm/ka and are only about one-third of the rates derived from 10Be. Model simulations in combination with published sediment yield data suggest that this discrepancy is caused by at least three factors: (1) phases with higher precipitation and/or lower evapotranspiration, (2) rare flood events not captured in the short-term records, and (3) prolonged periods of climatic deterioration with increased erosion and sediment transport on hillslopes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Meyer:2010black,"To determine how topographic relief in mountainous regions evolves through time we present a new approach that uses in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be to quantify (1) spatially averaged denudation rates of small watersheds and (2) local denudation rates of the ridge crests bounding these basins. The technique is applied to two catchments in the Black Forest, a forested mountain range with a local relief of a few hundred meters, which is typical for ranges in central Europe. Both the Acher and the Gutach catchments expose predominantly Carboniferous granite, and only minor amounts of high-grade gneiss and Triassic sandstone. The latter occurs on ridges defining the eastern boundaries of the catchments, above a regional unconformity. In the Acher and northern Gutach watersheds denudation rates of subcatchments derived from 10Be concentrations in stream sediment range from 52 to 87 mm/ka and 59 to 91 mm/ka, respectively. In contrast, grus samples from the ridge crests bounding both watersheds yield lower denudation rates of 34 to 59 mm/ka. The differences in denudation rates for sample pairs from individual subcatchments and adjacent ridge crests reveals that topographic relief is growing at a mean rate of 24 ± 12 mm/ka (with the exception of the flat southwestern part of the Gutach catchment, where catchment-wide denudation rates are similar to the rate of ridge crest lowering). The inferred rates of denudation and relief growth are consistent with erosion rates calculated from the known thickness of Triassic to Lower Jurassic sediments, which were once present above the regional unconformity but have been largely eroded during the exhumation of the Black Forest. The onset of exhumation ∼ 19 Ma ago is constrained by thermal modelling of apatite fission track data, which suggest a cooling rate of ∼ 3 °C/Ma. Combined with a geothermal gradient of 30 to 40 °C/km this cooling rate yields an average exhumation rate of 75-100 mm/ka for the modelled apatite fission track data, which is comparable to spatially averaged denudation rates derived from cosmogenic 10Be. Our new approach may help to determine whether tectonically active mountain ranges are in a topographic steady state, in which rates of rock uplift and denudation are equal, or if such a dynamic equilibrium has not yet been attained.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Miller:2016colonisation,"Throughout the Quaternary, the flora and fauna of Australia evolved and adapted to the high-amplitude, low- and high-frequency climate changes that characterized the ice-age cycles. However, during the last glacial cycle, between ∼120 and 15 ka, unprecedented irreversible changes in flora and fauna occurred, and in that same interval modern humans established their first firm presence in the landscape. Disentangling the impacts of the first-order trend toward a colder, drier planet through the Late Quaternary from the impacts of human colonization has been challenging, from both the chronological and paleoenvironmental perspectives. We utilize the stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen preserved in near-continuous time series of Dromaius (emu) eggshell from five regions across Australia to provide independent reconstructions of ecosystem status and climate over the past 100 ka. Carbon isotopes are determined by the diet consumed by the female bird, whereas oxygen isotopes record the status of local moisture balance in the months prior to breeding. Together, δ13C and δ18O provide ecosystem status and climate from the same dated sample, reducing correlation uncertainties between proxies. Combined with recent improvements in the chronologies of Late Quaternary shorelines fringing inland lake basins and deflation during arid times, these data collectively reaffirm that Australia generally became increasingly, albeit irregularly, drier from the last interglaciation through to the last glacial maximum. Dromaius eggshell δ18O documents peak aridity between 30 and 15 ka, but shows no evidence of exceptional climate change between 60 and 40 ka. In contrast, Dromaius δ13Cdiet documents an irreversible loss of the majority of palatable summer-rainfall-related C4 grasses across the Australian arid zone between 50 and 45 ka, about the same time that the giant megafaunal bird, Genyornis, became extinct, and coincident with human dispersal across the continent. Our data indicate that changes unique to Australia occurred between 50 and 45 ka that led to a new climate-vegetation relationship and an overall reduction in effective moisture across much of the continent. The large summer-rainfall-dominated lakes of interior Australia failed to re-fill subsequently, despite a wide range of global climate states. A full explanation for the mechanisms behind these changes remains elusive, but they are almost certainly related to human agency. Plausible explanations include a change in fire regime resulting from human-lit fires, a change in fire regime following extinction of megafaunal browsers, and/or a threshold response to increasing aridity. Of these, the climate change explanation is least likely, given the lack of evidence for unprecedented aridity between 60 and 40 ka, and the successful adaptation of Australian ecosystems to 2.5 Ma of similar changes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Miller:2016predation,"Although the temporal overlap between human dispersal across Australia and the disappearance of its largest animals is well established, the lack of unambiguous evidence for human–megafauna interactions has led some to question a human role in megafaunal extinction. Here we show that diagnostic burn patterns on eggshell fragments of the megafaunal bird Genyornis newtoni, found at >200 sites across Australia, were created by humans discarding eggshell in and around transient fires, presumably made to cook the eggs. Dating by three methods restricts their occurrence to between 53.9 and 43.4 ka, and likely before 47 ka. Dromaius (emu) eggshell occur frequently in deposits from >100 ka to present; burnt Dromaius eggshell first appear in deposits the same age as those with burnt Genyornis eggshell, and then continually to modern time. Harvesting of their eggs by humans would have decreased Genyornis reproductive success, contributing to the birds extinction by ∼47 ka.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Miller:2018wolfe,"A bolide that impacted NW Australia during the Late Quaternary left a circular depression more than 100 m deep and nearly a kilometer in diameter, with a crater rim ∼30 m above the regional terrain. The resultant crater is a window into the regional water table. The surface of the contemporary central pan is 25 m below the adjacent terrain, coincident with the late Holocene regional water table modified by local evaporative processes. Shielded from aeolian deflation by the crater rim, the central depression has slowly filled with dust, sand, and chemical precipitates, estimated to be 20–100 m thick based on geophysical surveys, one of the few continuous depocenters in the Australian Arid Zone. The nature of the crater's sediment fill is controlled by interactions between the water table, primarily in response to changes in summer monsoon rain, changes in the delivery of sand and dust to the crater by the prevailing easterly winds, and the level of the sedimentary fill surface. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) and 14C dates constrain an age model indicating the upper 10 m of sediment fill recovered from the central pan span the past ∼60 ka. The lowest 3 m consist of clayey sand deposited in perennial water during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. The water table subsequently dropped rapidly ∼35 ka and remained more than 7 m below the late Holocene level through most of MIS 2, during which 2 m of sandy clay was deposited on a dry crater floor, confirming a dry and dusty Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate. By 14 ka a rising water table intersected the crater surface, modifying the upper 50 cm of LGM sediment, and syndepositionally modifying another 60 cm of subsequent sandy clay deposition. Aeolian sediment delivery effectively ceased ∼13 ka, and the upper 4.8 m is a gypsum-dominated precipitate, which initially accumulated rapidly, before equilibrating with the late Holocene water table shortly after 6 ka. Lacustrine carbonate encrustations on rocks at the base of the crater wall and ∼4 m above the central pan with 14C ages >40 ka document a time when regional groundwater maintained a water body in the crater 3.5–4.5 m above the modern groundwater level. The crater wall deflected the prevailing easterly winds, creating a horseshoe-dune extending westerly on both sides of the crater, with an extension rate of 35 m ka1. An augered hole through the northern dune revealed 10 m of sediment overlying ferricrete. The lowest meter is a mixture of broken ferricrete and sand that we interpret to be debris from the bolide impact. Three OSL dates through the dune project an age for the debris-dune contact of 120  10 ka. Changes in physical properties and bulk sediment δ13C through the 9 m of aeolian sediment indicate the lowest 1.8 m was deposited during MIS 5 (120–85 ka), under a uniformly wetter climate than present. The overlying 4.3 m of sediment was deposited between 85 and 14 ka (MIS 4, 3, 2) and exhibits transitional characteristics between the lower unit and the upper 3.8 of sand, which was deposited primarily during the Holocene. Large changes in the regional water table occurred over the past 60 ka, including an LGM water table persistently ≥7 m lower than late Holocene levels, and 3.5–4.5 m higher prior to 40 ka, plausibly in MIS 5, indicative of a stronger Australian Summer Monsoon than at any time subsequently. Age models and sediment properties from the two sedimentary records indicate the crater was formed >60 ka and most likely ∼120 ka, more recently than previous estimates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Mitchell:1994cobourg,"This thesis is concerned with the process of and consequences of culture contact on the Cobourg Peninsula, northwestern Arnhem Land. Aboriginals from the Cobourg Peninsula came into regular and intensive contact with several groups of foreigners from the beginning of the eighteenth century. Macassan trepang fishermen from southern Sulawesi made annual voyages to the area. Britain attempted to establish two settlements, Fort Wellington and Victoria on the Cobourg Peninsula in the first half of the nineteenth century. From the end of the nineteenth century the Cobourg Peninsula was host to an assortment of timber getters, pastoralists, buffalo shooters and trepang fishermen of a variety of nationalities. Both archaeological and historical data are used in this thesis to address questions about two main issues. The first issue concerns the types of economic and social relationships which developed between Aboriginals and foreigners, and the chronological trends that can be identified in these relationships. The second, and most important issue concerns the degree to which culture contact impacted on Aboriginal hunter-gatherer economies on the Cobourg Peninsula. Ethnohistoric and ethnographic data are employed to develop models regarding the potential impact of culture contact on indigenous subsistence patterns, regional exchange networks and settlement patterns. In order to test these models, a series of midden sites from the Cobourg Peninsula have been recorded and excavated. Contrasts which can be identified between pre-contact and post-contact middens include changes in the relative frequency of turtle and dugong remains and the size and composition of stone artefact assemblages. Major differences in the size and structure of pre-contact and post-contact midden deposits are also apparent. These contrasts confirm that foreign contact was responsible for three major changes within the indigenous economy on the Cobourg Peninsula. Firstly, there was a dramatic increase in the intensity with which large marine animals were exploited. This change was facilitated by the widespread adoption of foreign maritime technology such as the dugout canoe and iron harpoons. Secondly, regional indigenous exchange networks in northwestern Arnhem Land, as reflected by the movement of material goods such as stone artefacts, accelerated after the onset of Macassan contact. Finally, a shift took place in the nature of Aboriginal settlement patterns on the coastline, with larger group sizes and decreased residential mobility during the post-contact period.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In this study, denudation rates from the present-day and ranging back to the Quaternary and the Pliocene are quantified using four independent methods allowing an investigation over different time scales: 1) compilation of present-day measured sediment fluxes, 2) determination of catchment-scale cosmogenic denudation rates through measurements of in situ-produced 10Be concentrations in sands sampled at the outlet of present-day rivers, 3) estimation of eroded volumes within catchments using a DEM to quantify long-term averaged Quaternary denudation rates, and 4) quantification of sediment volumes deposited within the marine realm of the Gulf of Lion.

Using zooarchaeological evidence from three caves in the Northern Swan Coastal Plain, southwestern Australia, this thesis explores landscape-scale Holocene environmental change and its relationship with Aboriginal subsistence. Changes in Aboriginal diet and environment are associated with increasing abundances of animal species that benefit from mosaic habitats. Given late Holocene climates were stable, marked changes in habitat c.1000 years ago are interpreted as resulting from the increased use of fire for land management.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Moon:2011washington,"Since the Last Glacial Maximum, the extent of glaciers in many mountainous regions has declined, and erosion driven by glacial processes has been supplanted by fluvial incision and mass wasting processes. This shift in the drivers of erosion is thought to have altered the rate and pattern of denudation of these landscapes. The Washington Cascades Mountains in the northwestern USA still bear the topographic imprint of Pleistocene glaciations, and are affected by large variations in precipitation, making them an ideal setting to assess the relative controls of denudation. Here we show that denudation rates over the past millennia, as determined by 10Be exposure ages, range from 0.08 to 0.57 mm yr−1, about four times higher than the rates inferred for million-year timescales. We find that the millennial timescale denudation rates increase linearly with modern precipitation rates. Based on our landscape analyses, we suggest that this relationship arises because intense precipitation triggers landslides, particularly on slopes that have been steepened by glacial erosion before or during the Last Glacial Maximum. We conclude that the high modern interglacial denudation rates we observe in the Washington Cascades are driven by a disequilibrium between the inherited topography and the current spatial distribution of erosional processes that makes this range particularly sensitive to spatial variations in climate.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Moon:2018mendocino,"The Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ) region in northern California is an archetype for studying landscape response to varying rock uplift rates as they increase toward the triple junction. Underpinning these studies lies the assumption that this landscape has reached a dynamic equilibrium in which rock uplift and erosion rates are equal; however, no study has shown that such an equilibrium actually exists around the MTJ region. Here, we report 10Be- and 26Al-derived erosion rates calculated from isotope concentrations in detrital, fluvial sediment from coastal drainage basins; we then compare these rates with uplift rates inferred from marine terraces that were formed and preserved by uplift during the last ∼305 ka. Erosion rates in the more slowly uplifting southern part of the region range from 0.21–0.32 mm/yr and are consistent with rock uplift rates since 305 ka. However, in the northern transition zone, where uplift rates apparently started to increase about ∼100 ka due to northward migration of the MTJ, erosion rates are higher, 0.43 to 0.69 mm/yr. These rates are similar to uplift rates from 96–305 ka, but substantially less than recent uplift rates of ∼3.5–4 mm/yr inferred for the past ∼72 ka. In the central part of the King Range, finite erosion rates cannot be determined due to (i) the presence of excess 10Be that does not appear to have originated from in-situ cosmic-ray production during erosion and transport of the sediment, and (ii) 26Al concentrations below detection limits. ...

Mooney:1997montane,"This study examines environmental change in the upper montane zone of the Australian Eastern Highlands during the late Holocene, by analysing vegetation, fire and erosion records contained within a small fen located in a frost hollow. Differences in environmental parameters across the prehistoric--historic boundary were particularly investigated in an attempt to characterise better the changes associated with the imposition of European land-use practices. Decreases in arboreal pollen and an increased charcoal concentration near the base of the analysed sequence, interpreted to be about 1600 y BP until about 1300 y BP, are suggestive of reduced moisture availability. After this, a period of relative stability continued to the close of the prehistoric period. The arrival of Europeans in the region triggered changes in the sediment record, including an increase in the accumulation of sediment by an order of magnitude, and changes in the surrounding vegetation. Saturated isothermal remnant magnetism (SIRM) was found to be significantly higher in the historic period compared to the analysed prehistoric period, suggesting an alteration in the erosional processes within the catchment. The concentration of charcoal was comparable between the prehistoric and historic periods; however, the increased sedimentation rate of the historic period infers an increased accumulation of charcoal. Fire did not appear to be related to the vegetation changes evident in the historic period, perhaps due to the use of cool fires by the pastoralists.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mooney:2001clues,"The concentration and influx of charcoal in a 210Pb-dated sediment core were used to investigate the recent fire history of Jibbon Lagoon in Royal National Park, NSW. Fire events of the recent (historic) past were compared to this record in an attempt to test its sensitivity. Recent fire events were not always reflected in the charcoal results. Nonetheless it can be concluded that since about AD 1930 the area has been characterized by a relatively high frequency of fires. The analysed sediments of the pre-European period contained a low concentration of charcoal, and only one large conflagration appears to have occurred in approximately the last 1600 years. How Aboriginal people used fire in this landscape is still uncertain. However, it is possible that they did not regularly burn the landscape, or if they did, it was in such a way that the delivery of charcoal to the lagoon was minimal.

Mooney:2006proxy,"The local fire history of a coastal swamp catchment in New South Wales was reconstructed using two proxy records of fire: sedimentary macroscopic charcoal and fire-scar analyses of Xanthorrhoea johnsonii. The charcoal analysis provided a record of fire activity spanning the last 2800 years, while the Xanthorrhoea record covered the last approx. 300 years. The ability of each method to accurately record fire events was verified by cross referencing against the recent (post 1968) historic fire record. Fire history was then extrapolated beyond the historic record, to reveal an unprecedented level of fire activity in the last 35 years, which coincides with increased human activity in the area. In the prehistoric period charcoal and fire scars are comparatively rare, which is most parsimoniously ascribed to little fire activity, but perhaps represents skilful fire manipulation, as is often attributed to Aboriginal people. The comparatively minor fluctuations in macroscopic charcoal during the prehistoric period were approximately coeval with previous evidence of late Holocene environmental change in south-eastern Australia, suggesting that fire frequency at the site responded to climatic variability.

This study aimed to document the local fire activity of the Holocene in the catchment of a small freshwater reed swamp located in the Sydney Basin and to compare this with nearby archaeological evidence; including artefact discard rates and the number of base camps and activity locations used through time. This archaeological evidence was used as an index of human activity through time to assess anthropogenic influences on fire activity. Charcoal (>250 mm) was quantified in a radiocarbon-dated sediment core from Griffith Swamp covering ~6000 calibrated years BP. A substantial increase in fire activity was found from ~3000 years BP and a lesser increase approximately 700 years ago. The change in fire activity at ~3000 years BP was approximately coeval with changes in archaeological evidence from Upper Mangrove Creek, suggesting either greater human presence in the landscape or altered subsistence and land-use strategies. Fire frequency in the catchment of Griffith Swamp peaked at about eight episodes per century, perhaps in response to environmental change that promoted both increased human activity and a higher natural fire frequency. This study provides an extended temporal perspective on fire and humans in this landscape, demonstrating how palaeoecology can provide practical information for the contemporary management of such fire-prone ecosystems.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Mooney:2020broughton,"In Australia, the drivers of precolonial fire regimes remain contentious, with some advocating an anthropogenic-dominated regime, and others highlighting the importance of climate, climatic variability or alternatively some nexus between climate and human activity. Here, we explore the inter-relationships between fire, humans and vegetation using macroscopic charcoal, archaeology and palynology over the last ~5430 cal. year BP from Broughton Island, a small, near-shore island located in eastern Australia. We find a clear link between fire and the reduction of arboreal pollen and rainforest indicators on the island, especially at ~4.0 ka and in the last ~1000 years. Similarities with comparable palaeoenvironmental records of fire in the region and a record of strong El Niño (dry, fire-prone) events supports the contention that climate was a significant influence on the fire regimes of Broughton Island. However, two periods of enhanced fire activity, at ~4000 years BP and ~<600 years BP have weaker links to climate, and perhaps reflect anthropogenic activity. Changes to the fire regime in the last ~600 years corresponds with the earliest evidence of Indigenous archaeology on the island, and coincides with implications that Polynesian people were present in the region. After the mid-Twentieth Century a human-dominated fire regime is also an obvious feature of the reconstructed fire record on Broughton Island.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Moore:2010niche,"A major problem in characterising rarity traits is that rare species are less studied than common species. Consequently, little is known about their distribution, ecology, demography, or behaviour, and their categorisation as rare may simply be a result of scarcity of data. In particular, there is a lack of comparative studies of closely-related rare and common species, an issue addressed by this thesis. My research investigated niche differentiation, rarity, and commonness in two sympatric species of rainforest rodents in the genus Uromys, one of which is common while the other is extremely rare, and endeavoured to provide insights into why this is so. This is an increasingly important question as continuing habitat destruction, fragmentation, and over-exploitation threaten the existence of many rare species and significantly decrease populations of what were once common species. The primary aim of the thesis is to clarify the ecological characteristics that make a species more prone to rareness and thus vulnerable to extinction. Prior to this study little was known of the ecology of the rare Pygmy White-tailed Rat Uromys hadrourus and, surprisingly, only basic distribution and population data was available for its sister species the common Giant White-tailed Rat Uromys caudimaculatus. To obtain the data necessary to facilitate an ecological comparison of the two species, a capture-mark-recapture program was conducted. Using the results from this study, niche differentiation analyses were used to compare the ecological and behavioural traits of the two Uromys species. The characteristics recognised in the literature as potentially predisposing a species to rarity were examined in light of the niche analyses. ... [truncated]",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,
Moore:2019magnetite,"Quartz is widely used as a target mineral for determining watershed-averaged denudation rates because it is resistant to chemical weathering, geologically widespread, and has a well-constrained 10Be production rate. However, quartz is not available in many landscapes developed on mafic to intermediate igneous rocks. This creates a need to develop new target minerals that are applicable in these environments. Magnetite is a common accessory mineral in many rock types without quartz and, like quartz, is resistant to chemical weathering. Here we evaluate magnetite's suitability as a target mineral by comparing denudation rates inferred from 36Cl in magnetite to 10Be in quartz at 12 watersheds in the Sierra Nevada region of California. We find that magnetite and quartz produce denudation rates that are in broad agreement, validating the use of magnetite. The reproducibility between the two minerals is comparable to the reproducibility of measurements of 10Be from repeat samples of quartz from a single catchment. This level of variance is likely attributable to the stochastic nature of erosion and sediment supply in small, mountainous watersheds.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here we report excavations at two sites in this complex: Gunu Rock, a sand sheet adjacent to rock art panels; and Gunu Cave, a floor deposit within an extensive rockshelter. Excavations at Gunu Rock provide evidence for two phases of occupation, the first from 7–8 to 2.7 ka, and the second from 1064 cal BP. Excavations at Gunu Rock provide evidence for occupation from the end of the second phase to the recent past. Stone for tools in the early phase were procured from a variety of sources, but quartz crystal reduction dominated the second occupation phase. Small quartz crystals were reduced by freehand percussion to provide small flake tools and blanks for manufacturing small points called nguni by the Wunambal people today. Quartz crystals were prominent in historic ritual practices associated with the Wanjina belief system. Complex methods of making bifacially-thinned and pressure flaked quartzite projectile points emerged after 2.7 ka. Ochre pigments were common in both occupation phases, but evidence for occupation contemporaneous with the putative age of the oldest rock art styles was not discovered in the excavations.

The robustness of the method is demonstrated by the fact that, although the area was affected by river capture at 18 kyr bp , the formed gorge is so narrow that spatially averaged erosion rates were not resolvably perturbed. However, because cosmogenic nuclides preserve an erosion memory of several thousand years, the only perturbation introduced was detected in the minor areas that have been subject to the last maximum glaciation. In unglaciated areas, an important relationship between lithology and erosion can by quantified: sandstone lithologies erode at 12–18 mm kyr−1, granite lithologies at 35–47 mm kyr−1 and limestone lithologies (as deduced from river load gauging) at 70–90 mm kyr−1.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Despite the region's recognized seismic risk, the geometry of faults likely to host large earthquakes remains poorly understood. Here, we place new constraints on the spatial distribution of rock uplift within the western-400 km of the central seismic gap using topographic and river profile analyses together with basinwide erosion rate estimates from cosmogenic 10Be. The data sets show a distinctive physiographic transition at the base of the high Himalaya in the state of Uttarakhand, India, characterized by abrupt strike-normal increases in channel steepness and a tenfold increase in erosion rates. When combined with previously published geophysical imaging and seismicity data sets, we interpret the observed spatial distribution of erosion rates and channel steepness to reflect the landscape response to spatially variable rock uplift due to a structurally coherent ramp-flat system of the Main Himalayan Thrust. Although it remains unresolved whether the kinematics of the Main Himalayan Thrust ramp involve an emergent fault or duplex, the landscape and erosion rate patterns suggest that the décollement beneath the state of Uttarakhand provides a sufficiently large and coherent fault segment capable of hosting a great earthquake. 2015 Geological Society of America.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Morwood:1978kens,"A date has been obtained for engraved art at a site in central- western Queensland. This may have more general implications for the art of the area. Ken‘s Cave is a rock-shelter located near the crest of the Great Divide, between the Barcoo and Belyando drainage systems, in central-western Queensland. It occurs at the base of a sandstone cliff of the Precipice Series, and from it a slope of large sandstone blocks descends to a forested sand flat. Here vegetation is predominantly of Black Wattle (Acacia cunninghamii). Narrow-leaved iron-bark woodland (Eucalyptus drepanophylla) is found beyond this on the steep slope down to undulating flats. These are dominated by communities of brigalow regrowth (A. harpophylla), brigalow-blackbutt forest (A. harpophylla-E. cambageana), silver-leaved iron-bark woodland (E. melanophloia), and poplar box grassy woodlands (E. populnea). The present property-owner knows of no water-source close to the site. The site measures 13 by 7m, with a maximum height at the drip-line of 6 m. It faces due west (Fig. l). An occupation deposit is evident at the drip-line, where ash, charcoal, stone tools and bone have been exposed by erosion, and are slumping down a steep, poorly consolidated scarp of sand and talus. A grindstone was also found in situ. On the floor of the shelter, a number of sandstone blocks occur, and engravings occur on five of these. The largest block measures 4 by 2.5 m, with a maximum height of 1 m. This example dominates the shelter, and has a particularly numerous and varied range of engravings upon it (Fig.2). ...

Morwood:1979thesis,"This thesis explores the potential of a multi-attribute approach to the prehistory of, central western Queensland. Two artefacts of Aboriginal culture are examined in detail stone tools and rock art. For the stone analysis, excavated assemblages from four rockshelter sites are used to define regional changes in central western stone-use over the past 11,000 years. Spatial patter ning of artefactual material within sites is also described and related to site use-structure and specific, depositional processes. The results of the sequential and spatial analyses are then compared with those obtained from , other sites in the area, particularly Kenniff and Cathedral Caves. A three-part sequence is defined for Central Queensland and related to general patterns of change in Australian Aboriginal stone use. The analysis of rock art in Central Queensland is based on information from 92 recorded art sites. The history of previous work on the art of the region is briefly outlined and the details of the art recording and classification systems given. A variety of techniques is used to define a relative, then a dated artistic sequence which spans a minimum of 4,200 years. Synchronic variation within broadly contemporaneous art assemblages is used in conjunction with contextual evidence to suggest the former role of rock art in local Aboriginal culture. The implications of sequential change in several aspects of the artistic system are discussed in a wider context, with particular reference to evidence from other areas of Queensland and to general models for change in Australian Aboriginal rock art. In the conclusions, the results of the stone and rock art analyses are compared, contrasted, and common explanatory mechanisms advanced.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Research has demonstrated significant change in the Australian archaeological sequence and general trends of such are shared by numerous regions. Most that have been investigated indicate low density occupation during the Pleistocene and early Holocene with significant increases in site numbers, increased artefact discard rates and dissemination of new technologies and artefact types in mid-to-late Holocene times (e.g. Lourandos 1985). On the other hand, each region has a unique prehistory, range of material evidence and research potential. Our knowledge of Holocene developments in aboriginal subsistence systems, for instance, is largely based upon the history of cycad exploitation in the central Queensland Highlands (Beaton 1982), the appearance of seed grindstones in arid and semi-arid zones (Smith 1986) and evidence for increased emphasis on small-bodied animals in N.E.

Moss:2000humid,"A detailed pollen record from the Ocean Drilling Program Site 820 core, located on the upper part of the continental slope off the coast of northeast Queensland, was constructed to compare with the existing pollen record from Lynch's Crater on the adjacent Atherton Tableland and allow the production of a regional picture of vegetation and environmental change through the last glacial cycle. Some broad similarities in patterns of vegetation change are revealed, despite the differences between sites and their pollen catchments, which can be related largely to global climate and sea-level changes. The original estimated time scale of the Lynch's Crater record is largely confirmed from comparison with the more thoroughly dated ODP record. Conversely, the Lynch's Crater pollen record has assisted in dating problematic parts of the ODP record. In contrast to Lynch's Crater, which reveals a sharp and sustained reduction in drier araucarian forest around 38,000 yrs BP, considered to have been the result of burning by Aboriginal people, the ODP record indicates, most likely, a stepwise reduction, dating from 140,000 yrs BP or beyond. The earliest reduction shows lack of a clear connection between Araucaria decline and increased burning and suggests that people may not have been involved at this stage. However, a further decline in araucarian forest, possibly around 45,000 yrs BP, which has a more substantial environmental impact and is not related to a time of major climate change, is likely, at least partially, the result of human burning. The suggestion, from the ODP core oxygen isotope record, of a regional sea-surface temperature increase of around 4ºC between about 400,000 and 250,000 yrs BP, may have had some influence on the overall decline in Araucaria and its replacement by sclerophyll vegetation.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Moss:2005riverine,"Mechanisms of pollen transport in the humid tropics region of northeastern Australia were investigated to support the interpretation of a long Quaternary pollen record from ODP Site 820 located on the adjacent continental slope. Pollen analysis of surface sediment samples from the channels of two major river catchments demonstrated internal consistency in pollen spectra and little fluvial pollen sorting in relation to sediment variation. Differences in modern pollen spectra between catchments reflect existing variation in vegetation cover that, in turn, reflects climatic differences between catchments. Recent pollen spectra from top samples of the ODP core have sufficient in common with the riverine samples to suggest that the rivers are contributing a major pollen component to the offshore sediments, but these have been size sorted by marine action. Recent pollen samples from core tops taken from the Grafton Passage on the continental shelf that was thought to be the major passage for pollen transport to ODP Site 820 show significant differences to both riverine and ODP samples and suggest that pollen are dispersed across the continental shelf and through the outer Great Barrier Reef system in a more complex way than anticipated.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,
Moss:2007marine,"A late Quaternary marine palynological record from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 820, adjacent to the humid tropics region of northeastern Australia, has demonstrated marked variation in orbital scale cyclicity, and also trends associated with both climate and human impact. However, some uncertainties in interpretation have resulted from concerns about the records chronology and continuity. Here we present, for the first time, the complete palynological data from detailed analysis of the top 67 m of sediment and examine it in relation to the marine isotope sequence from the core. It is proposed that the record is relatively continuous through the last 250,000 years although the latter part of oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5, as well OIS 4 may be missing. Despite the variation on orbital scales, most palynological changes are not in phase with those from the marine isotope record suggesting a lack of direct Milankovitch forcing on vegetation. This lack of correspondence combined with major trends towards more open and sclerophyllous vegetation in association with increased burning supports a previous proposal that major control is being exercised by El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability whose influence may have been initiated by changes in oceanic circulation in the region within the mid Pleistocene. The lack of impact on the distribution of complex rainforest suggests that increased climate variability did not involve an overall decrease in total precipitation.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

This sequence reflects the influence of falling sea-levels, development of a coastal dune barrier system, prograding shorelines, and an extreme storm (cyclone) event. In addition, there is clear evidence of the impacts that human abandonment and resettlement have on the island's fire regimes and vegetation. A dramatic increase in burning and vegetation thickening was observed after the cessation of traditional Indigenous Kaiadilt fire management practices in the 1940s, and was then reversed when people returned to the island in the 1980s.

This new chronology provides a robust geochronological framework for interpreting environmental records across the region. In particular, our age model helps to resolve several debates concerning the timing of climatic changes and their impacts on both the marine and the terrestrial systems, as well as possible human arrival and associated impacts on the region's ecosystems.

Large quantities of animal bone were recovered and the analysis of these supplies the major data for the research.  Three main issues are addressed:  1. The nature of the relationship between the early humans and their environment through the period that covers the late glacial maximum at about 18,000 bp.  2. The relationship between humans and the extinct species, including the thylacine, Thylacinus cynocephalus, which was a major predator at the site, contributing bone to the deposits during the Pleistocene.  3.The use of faunal evidence as an indicator of economic and subsistence activities as well as local environmental changes.  The data show that the human activity during the late Pleistocene at Nombe was sporadic over the period from about 25,000 bp to about 15,000 bp. Hunters were probably targeting the large herbivores living in high altitude forest and other species adapted to high altitude cold environments. Humans and large herbivores coexisted for about 10,000 years before the animals disappeared from the record.

Mowat:1995arnhem,"This thesis addresses variability in shell middens deposited during the Mid to Late Holocene in western Arnhem Land, Australia. Throughout this time, the inhabitants of western Arnhem Land exploited a wide variety of marine resources. Evidence of exploitation of marine and estuarine molluscs can be found in the form of shell middens deposited throughout the landscape, on the coastal strip and estuarine plains further south and in rockshelters situated in outliers of the escarpment. I aim to test existing models which classified middens into a few inflexible types, and which identified simple chronological changes. The integrity of these models is examined by a review of the data used to construct them, and by testing against them previously unrecorded midden sites. Some authors have identified chronological changes in the relative abundance of species in middens, notably Cerithidea obtusa. and in the location in which middens were deposited. Models of simple unidirectional change in relative abundance of Cerithidea across a broad geographic area are not supported. Rockshelters were not all abandoned in favour of coastal plains at 3000 BP. Conversely, the coastal plains were not only used after 3000 BP. Midden variability has not been acknowledged by previous researchers. Models regarding middens have typically characterised these sites as being homogeneous.

Mueller:2018murrumbidgee,"The Riverine Plain in south-eastern Australia contains numerous palaeochannels that are much larger than the present rivers and provide evidence about past hydrological conditions. Previous research suggested optima in fluvial activity both before and after the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21  3 ka), and, in some cases, throughout the LGM. In this study, we revisit palaeochannel remnants of the Gum Creek and Yanco palaeochannel systems along the Murrumbidgee River, which drains the high-elevation catchments of the Australian Alps in south-eastern Australia. We date fluvial and aeolian sediments using single-grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and apply thermoluminescence (TL) dating to a subset of samples. We compare the OSL ages to new and previously published TL ages and investigate reasons for age discrepancies between these methods, possible effects of partial bleaching and other factors that may affect luminescence ages. We propose a new OSL-based chronology for the Gum Creek and Yanco palaeochannel systems and assign periods of enhanced fluvial activity for the Tombullen and Yanco phases to 41–29 and 29–18 ka, respectively.

Muller:2008principle,"The Lynchs Crater peat deposit in NE-Australia is a sensitive environmental archive located in the tropical Southern Hemisphere. This unique deposit illustrates that local and regional changes had a profound effect on the local Australian ecosystem over the past 55kyr. To obtain a proxy of past climate changes, trace and major element geochemistry analyses were applied to a 13m peat core from the crater. Principle component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the main factors that control elemental distribution in the peat and to add interpretative strength to the geochemical behavior of selected major and trace elements. For example, Sc, Al, Cu, and Pb were found to be related to increased erosion of the basin soils, and from this, several periods of significant flux from atmospheric input and/or terrigenous run-off were identified. Geochemically mobile elements during rock weathering and pedogenesis, such as Mg, Ca, and Sr helped to identify the peat ombrotrophic–minerotrophic boundary at ∼1.5m depth and offered important information about fluxes of these nutrients to the mire and their dynamics within the deposit. Arsenic and V comparisons between the peat record (high concentrations in some peat sections) and in local basin rocks (very low concentrations), suggested the presence of a long range, atmospheric dust source early in the formation of the mire. The Lynchs Crater peat record presents a continuous record of environmental change in tropical Australia and contributes new understanding to geochemical processes in peatlands.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Munack:2014outpaced,"The Indus River, one of Asia's premier rivers, drains the western Tibetan Plateau and the Nanga Parbat syntaxis. These two areas juxtapose some of the lowest and highest topographic relief and commensurate denudation rates in the Himalaya-Tibet orogen, respectively, yet the spatial pattern of denudation rates upstream of the syntaxis remains largely unclear, as does the way in which major rivers drive headward incision into the Tibetan Plateau. We report a new inventory of 10Be-based basinwide denudation rates from 33 tributaries flanking the Indus River along a 320 km reach across the western Tibetan Plateau margin. We find that denudation rates of up to 110 mm k.y.-1 in the Ladakh and Zanskar Ranges systematically decrease eastward to 10 mm k.y.-1 toward the Tibetan Plateau. Independent results from bulk petrographic and heavy mineral analyses support this denudation gradient. Assuming that incision along the Indus exerts the base-level control on tributary denudation rates, our data show a systematic eastward decrease of landscape downwearing, reaching its minimum on the Tibetan Plateau. In contrast, denudation rates increase rapidly 150-200 km downstream of a distinct knickpoint that marks the Tibetan Plateau margin in the Indus River longitudinal profile. We infer that any vigorous headward incision and any accompanying erosional waves into the interior of the plateau mostly concerned reaches well below this plateau margin. Moreover, reported long-term (>106 yr) exhumation rates from low-temperature chronometry of 0.1-0.75 mm yr-1 consistently exceed our 10Be-derived denudation rates. With averaging time scales of 103-104 yr for our denudation data, we report postglacial rates of downwearing in a tectonically idle landscape. To counterbalance this apparent mismatch, denudation rates must have been higher in the Quaternary during glacial-interglacial intervals. 2014 Geological Society of America.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Munack:2016indus,"Rivers draining the semiarid Transhimalayan Ranges at the western Tibetan Plateau margin underwent alternating phases of massive valley infill and incision in Pleistocene times. The effects of these cut-and-fill cycles on millennial sediment fluxes have remained largely elusive. We investigate the timing and geomorphic consequences of headward incision of the Zanskar River, a tributary to the Indus, which taps the >250-m thick More Plains valley fill that currently plugs the endorheic high-altitude basins of Tso Kar and Tso Moriri. In situ 10Be exposure dating and topographic analyses show that a phase of valley infill gave way to net dissection and the NW Himalaya's first directly dated stream capture in late Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, ∼135 ka ago. Headwaters of the Indus are currently capturing headwaters of the Sutlej, and rivers have eroded >14.7 km3 of sediment from the Zanskar headwaters since, mobilising an equivalent of ∼8\% of the Indus' contemporary sediment storage volume from only 0.3\% of its catchment area. The resulting specific sediment yields are among the rarely available rates averaged over the 105-yr timescale, and surpass 10Be-derived denudation rates from neighbouring catchments three- to tenfold. We conclude that recycling of Pleistocene valley fills has fed Transhimalayan headwaters with more sediment than liberated by catchment denudation, at least since the last glacial cycle began. This protracted release of sediment from thick Pleistocene valley fills might bias estimates of current sediment loads and long-term catchment denudation.

Aspartic acid racemisation, in conjunction with radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic evidence, indicates that Greenglade rockshelter was occupied episodically since AD 1300. The variation in the amino acid results obtained in this study help to define the limitations of applying the amino acid racemisation (AAR) method to middens of recent origin. Comparison of AAR analyses on shell of equivalent age and known not to have been burnt, suggests that some of the shells within the middens have been reworked and/or heated during multiple episodes of rockshelter occupation. Cultural evidence indicates that the rockshelter was used until historically-recent times, well after British colonisation and possibly as late as the middle twentieth century. The difficulties of dating this interval are also considered in the context of the contact period in Australia. It is concluded that dating midden materials of recent age, known to have been heated by camp fires, is a particularly difficult task by the AAR method, but that meaningful results may be obtained if the technique is used with caution.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In situ produced cosmogenic nuclides, such as 10Be and 26Al, provide a valuable insight but are not entirely free from complications. In this study, denudation rates are determined for the Abukuma Mountains, Japan, using both site-specific and basin-scale methods. Considered with density measured in the field, distinct and systematic differences between the two methods are identified. Site-specific rates calculated from depth profiles of cosmogenic nuclides (10Be and 26Al) at topographic highs indicate a rate of 67 to 85 mm/kyr, whereas basin-scale averaged denudation rates derived from the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in fluvial sediments show 114 to 180 mm/kyr. This is the first comparison of these two commonly used methods in the same region in Japan, where the entire study area is characterized by well-developed saprolite.

Adjustment of the 14C ages to take geomagnetic effects into account further improves the correlation between these two independent dating techniques.

Nanson:1991tropics,"Thermoluminescence (TL) age determinations of alluvial sediments in the tropics are evaluated by comparison with U/Th age determinations of pedogenic accumulations in the alluvium of the lower Gilbert River, a large fan delta in the wet-dry tropics of northern Queensland, Australia. This study extends U/Th dating by applying it not only to calcretes, but also to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide/oxide accumulations. While a direct correlation cannot be made between U/Th dates from secondary minerals and TL dates from the host sediments, both sets of data show broad consistency. In addition to providing a minima for acceptable TL ages, U/Th dates are useful for determining the chronology of pedogenesis/diagenesis. They show that calcretes and ferricretes have formed under similar climatic conditions in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia during the late pleistocene. Beneath about 5-12 m the Gilbert fan delta consists of an extensive sand body older than 85,000 yr and probably about 120,000 yr in age, representative of a period of major fluvial activity not repeated since this time.

Nanson:1992birdsville,"The longitudinal dunes of the Simpson Desert, in the vicinity of Birdsville, have been reworked largely during the Holocene from dunes deposited up to 80000 years ago or earlier. The widespread asymmetry of these roughly northward-trending dunes, with steeper eastern faces and more gentle western faces, supports wind-rose data showing sand-transporting winds from the southwest obliquely intersecting the dunes. While this suggests a change in the wind pattern since the dune field was oriented, it does not indicate that the dunes are necessarily shifting leeward (eastward) as a consequence. It is hypothesized that the direction of migration is controlled by the extent to which the dunes are vegetated. Relatively well-vegetated dunes can accrete sand on their gentle stoss slopes and erode on their lee slopes causing them to shift westward and hence obliquely into the wind, a condition that probably prevails in wetter regions and during episodes of relatively humid climate. In contrast, in very dry areas or during arid phases, sand can move unimpeded up a sparsely vegetated stoss face and over the crest to form an avalanche or slip face on the lee side, thereby causing the dunes to shift eastward. Despite evidence that longitudinal dune crests can shift laterally to some extent, the dunes in the western part of the Simpson Desert have not migrated, either westward or eastward, more than 100m or so from their Pleistocene cores. Aeolian transport and partial or complete removal of iron cutans from around quartz grains results in dunes of widely varying colour yet of similar age.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

During the last interglacial, fluvial activity in central Australia peaked at ∼110 ka (stage 5 pluvial), probably ∼5-10 ka behind world temperature and sea-level maxima. Following the last late interglacial wet phase, aridity associated with dune building spread from central Australia toward its margins, achieving greatest intensity during the last glacial maximum. A less widespread wet phase, identified at about 55-35 ka (stage 3 subpluvial), is associated with high lake levels and paleochannel activity in southeastern Australia.

Nanson:1993magela,"Magela Creek, a major tributary of the East Alligator River in northern Australia, has left a detailed sedimentary record of a fluvial landscape dominated by climatic and eustatic changes associated with Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles. Uranium-series dates from young pisoliths in floodplain deposits indicate that ferruginisation is probably ongoing under present conditions while ferricretes in degraded terraces that flank the lower valley reveal a fluvial history extending back to early Pleistocene or Tertiary time. Inset within this older alluvium is a valley fill which, from thermoluminescence dates, was initiated about 300 kyr ago. With each glacial climate change and associated fall in sea level, distinct palaeochannels have been eroded into these floodplains, infilling later with alluvium when climate and base-level conditions were conducive to fluvial deposition. Radiocarbon dates show that the most recent palaeochannel beneath the modern Magela Creek last started to fill by downstream progradation and vertical accretion of bedload sand about 8 kyr. The palaeochannel filled at an accelerating rate, probably as a result of declining stream competence associated with drier conditions in the late Holocene augmented by the backwater effects of sea-level rise. Continued aggradation blocked the mouths of tributary valleys along Magela Creek, forming alluvial-dammed tributary lakes and deferred-junction tributary streams. From about 300 kyr, cyclic episodes of channel incision and sediment evacuation in this tropical-monsoon river valley have become less effective, possibly because increasing aridity in the late Quaternary has reduced the erosional effectiveness of Australia's northern rivers. Reduced flow regime and rising sea level in the late Holocene has resulted in the latest phase of alluvial accretion.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Nanson:1995simpson,"Sediments near Finke in central Australia provide evidence of late Quaternary evolution and the interaction of aeolian and fluvial systems in response to changing climate in the western Simpson Desert. Thermoluminescence (TL) dating is used to develop a chronology of aeolian and alluvial activity and to identify differences in sand provenance. Quaternary alluviation in the Finke valley at this location occurred at or prior to c 90 ka and with no surviving evidence of subsequent activity until the Holocene. In contrast to rivers in the eastern part of the Lake Eyre basin, substantial alluviation took place here in the early to mid-Holocene, probably due to reactivation of the northern monsoon and its partial penetration into central Australia. The regional dunefield near Finke consists of linear dunes largely reworked and aligned during the last glacial (30-12 ka) as part of the great anticlockwise whorl of dunes in central Australia. The oldest dated source-bordering dunes from the Finke River are bright red in colour, were deposited at c 100 ka and are now buried beneath paler source-bordering dunes. The latter consist of two exposed units; a lower one of unknown orientation that dates at 17-9 ka, and an upper unit, aligned to the northwest and parallel to the prevailing winds, that dates at 5-0 ka. The TL signature and sediment texture of the oldest source-bordering dunes show them to have probably been derived from weathered alluvial red-beds of similar or greater age nearby, and to have contributed abundant sand to the regional dunefield immediately north of the river. In contrast, sand from the younger, paler source-bordering dunes appears to be from a different source and to have only recently extended into the regional field. The Finke region would seem to be in a pivotal position for the study of palaeowind patterns that have created and modified Australia's whorl of continental dunes. The 30-18 ka regional linear-dunes near Finke are oriented almost due north. Their cross-sectional asymmetry (steeper eastern slopes) suggests a response to southwesterly or westerly sand-transporting winds between 18 and 10 ka; these winds appear to have shifted to their present southeast orientation during the past 5 ka. From dune ages, alignments and asymmetry, it is proposed here that there was a northward shift in the wind pattern at Finke by about 100-150 km (1-1.5° of latitude) during the last glacial, but that through this period the regional dune pattern has remained remarkably stable.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The playas near its depocentre, the driest region of Australia, contain a partial record of Quaternary climatic and hydrologic events for the last full glacial cycle, and probably beyond. Ancient beach-ridges marginal to lakes Eyre, Frome, Callabonna and Blanche have been dated using thermoluminescence (TL) to provide evidence for major changes in the hydrological regime of the basin. Beach ridges around Lake Eyre provide evidence of high-lake stands up to 27 m above the present lake floor during what probably corresponds to the middle to latter part of Marine Oxygen Isotope Stage 5. There is evidence also for even higher lake stands associated with earlier isotope stages. Three TL dates identify a period of aeolian activity during Stage 4 and a further 5 TL dates from lakes Eyre and Frome indicate that high lake stands occurred between about 55 and 40 ka, corresponding with Stage 3. The Stage 5 and Stage 3 high stands both relate to periods of enhanced fluvial activity previously identified in the Lake Eyre basin and elsewhere in Australia. In contradiction with other work, a few TL dates from some playas suggest a possible major episode of high lake levels immediately preceding or at the start of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (26–22 ka). This may relate to a sharp temperature suppression and an increase in runoff by rivers fed from monsoons in the north. While a set of relatively low-elevation late Holocene beaches have been dated on two of the playas, a period of enhanced precipitation and stream flow in the early to mid-Holocene appears not to have formed higher beaches, possibly due to high temperatures and evaporation rates at that time. The filling of Lake Eyre during and since Stage 5 appears to have been to no more than to a level of ∼12 m Australian height datum (AHD), possibly due a spillway at about this elevation in the form of the Warrawoocara Channel connecting Lake Eyre with playas to the southeast (lakes Gregory, Blanche, Callabonna and Frome). Such overflows from one large basin to another would have had a major impact on the hydrology of the region. In addition to enhanced runoff, essential for the maintenance of high lake levels must have been local temperatures and evaporation rates significantly reduced from present day levels.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Nanson:2005induration,"Late Quaternary alluvial induration has greatly influenced contemporary channel morphology on the anabranching Gilbert River in the monsoon tropics of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Gilbert, one of a number of rivers in this region, has contributed to an extensive system of coalescing low-gradient and partly indurated riverine plains. Extensive channel sands were deposited by enhanced flow conditions during marine oxygen isotope (OI) Stage 5. Subsequent flow declined, probably associated with increased aridity, however, enhanced runoff recurred again in OI Stages 4–3 (∼65–50 ka). Aridity then capped these plains with 4–7 m of mud. A widespread network of sandy distributary channels was incised into this muddy surface from sometime after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the mid Holocene during a fluvial episode more active than the present but less so than those of OI Stages 5 and 3. This network is still partly active but with channel avulsion and abandonment now occurring largely proximal to the main Gilbert flow path. A tropical climate and reactive catchment lithology have enhanced chemical weathering and lithification of alluvium along the river resulting in the formation of small rapids, waterfalls and inset gorges, features characteristic more of bedrock than alluvial systems. Thermoluminescence (TL) and comparative optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of the sediments are presented along with U/Th ages of pedogenic calcrete and Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide/ oxide accumulations. They show that calcrete precipitated during the Late Quaternary at times similar to those that favoured ferricrete formation, possibly because of an alternating wet–dry climate. Intense chemical alteration of the alluvium leading to induration appears to have prevailed for much of the Late Quaternary but, probably due to exceptional dryness, not during the LGM. The result has been restricted channel migration and a reduced capacity for the channel to adjust and accommodate sudden changes in bedload. Consequent avulsions have caused local stream powers to increase by an order of magnitude, inducing knickpoint erosion, local incision and the sudden influx of additional bedload that has triggered further avulsions. The Gilbert River, while less energetic than its Pleistocene ancestors, is clearly an avulsive system, and emphasizes the importance in some tropical rivers of alluvial induration for reinforcing the banks, generating nickpoints, reworking sediment and thereby developing and maintaining an indurated and anabranching river style.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Nanson:2008alluvial,"As a low-gradient arid region spanning the tropics to the temperate zone, the Lake Eyre basin has undergone gentle late Cenozoic crustal warping leading to substantial alluvial deposition, thereby forming repositories of evidence for palaeoclimatic and palaeohydrological changes from the Late Tertiary to the Holocene. Auger holes and bank exposures at five locations along the lower 500~km of Cooper Creek, a major contributor to Lake Eyre in the eastern part of the basin, yielded 85 luminescence dates (TL and OSL) that, combined wit a further 142 luminescence dates from northeastern Australia, have established a chronology of multiple episodes of enhanced flow regime from about 750~ka to the Holocene. Mean bankfull discharges on Cooper Creek upstream of the Innamincka Dome at 250-230~ka or oxygen isotope stages (OIS) 7-6 are estimated to have been 5 to 7 times larger than those of today, however, substantially less reworking has occurred during and after OIS 5 than before. Lower Cooper Creek appears to have similarly declined. In the Tirari Desert adjacent to Lake Eyre there is evidence of widespread alluvial activity, perhaps during but certainly before the Middle Pleistocene, yet the river became laterally restricted in OIS 7 to 5. While the Quaternary has been characterised by a dramatically oscillating wet-dry climate, since oxygen isotope stage OIS 7 or 6 there has been a general decline in the magnitude of the episodes of wetness to which the eastern part of central Australia has periodically returned. During the last full glacial cycle, Cooper Creek's periods of greatest runoff and sand transport were not during the last interglacial maximum of OIS 5e (132-122~ka) but later in OIS 5 when sea levels and global temperatures were substantially below those of 5e or today. Fluvial activity returned in OIS 4 and 3, but not to the extent of mid and late OIS 5; strongly seasonal but still powerful flows transported sand and fed source-bordering dunes in OIS 5 and 3. This chronology of fluvial activity in the late Quaternary broadly coincides with that for rivers of southeastern Australia and suggests that the wet phases in eastern central Australia have not been governed as much by the northern monsoon as by conditions in the western Pacific close to the east coast both north and south. Flow confinement within the Innamincka Dome has locally amplified Cooper Creek's energy, and here evidence exists for short but high-magnitude episodes of flow during the Last Glacial Maximum and in the early to middle Holocene, conditions that were capable of forming large palaeochannels but that were not long-lived enough to rework the river's extensive floodplains elsewhere along its length.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Neely:2019california,"Although many steep landscapes comprise a patchwork of soil-mantled and bare-bedrock hillslopes, models typically assume hillslopes are entirely soil-mantled or bare-bedrock, making it challenging to predict how rock properties influence hillslope erodibility and landscape evolution. Here, we study headwater catchments across the San Gabriel Mountains (SGM) and Northern San Jacinto Mountains (NSJM) in southern California; two steep landscapes with similar climate and lithology, but with distinctly different bedrock fracture densities, ∼5× higher in the SGM. We combine new and published detrital in-situ cosmogenic 10Be-derived erosion rates with analysis of high resolution imagery and topography to quantify how the morphology and abundance of bare-bedrock and soil-mantled hillslopes vary with erosion rate within and between the two landscapes. For similar mean hillslope angles (35-46°), catchments in the NSJM erode at rates of 0.1-0.6 m kyr−1, compared to 0.2-2.2 m kyr−1 in the SGM. In both landscapes, bare-bedrock hillslopes increase in abundance with increasing erosion rate; however, more and steeper bedrock is exposed in the NSJM, indicating that wider bedrock fracture spacing reduces soil production efficiency and supports steeper cliffs. Additionally, higher erosion rates in the SGM require a 3× higher soil transport efficiency, reflecting an indirect control of bedrock fracture density on the size of sediment armoring hillslopes. Our data highlight how hillslope morphodynamics in steep landscapes depend on the strength of soil and bedrock and the efficiency of soil production and transport, all of which are variably sensitive to rock properties and influence the partitioning of soil and bare-bedrock on hillslopes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Negishi:2009kasasinabwana,"This is a preliminary excavation report on the Kasasinabwana shell midden of Wari Island. We seek to establish a chronological history of prehistoric ceramics in southern Massim in order to assess Geoffrey Irwin‘s colonization hypothesis regarding the Early Papuan Pottery (EPP) period. An analysis of ceramics, other tools and faunal remains has allowed the definition of three ceramic periods, corresponding physically to Upper, Middle and Lower layers, in the inhabited history of the site. In the Upper Layers, which make up the main deposit of the site, links to the ethnographic Kuta or Kune are indicated by imported pottery and certain types of shellfish. During this period, the intensive use and discarding of shellfish made the site a shell midden. The earlier era (1600-2300 cal BP) corresponding to the Middle Layers contains red-slipped and related types of pottery. The Lower Layers contain much older pottery, referred to here as Kasasinabwana Plain Pottery (KPP). The dates of these layers are 2300-2600, 2600-2800 cal BP and the KPP may provide evidence of an earlier colonization other than that of the EPP.

Nelson:2016variation,"Climate, atmospheric pCO2, and fire all may exert major influences on the relative abundance of C3 and C4 grasses in the present-day vegetation. However, the relative role of these factors in driving variation in C3 and C4 grass abundances in the paleorecord is uncertain, and C4 abundance is often interpreted narrowly as a proxy indicator of aridity or pCO2. We measured δ13C values of individual grains of grass (Poaceae) pollen in the sediments of two sites in southeastern Australia to assess changes in the proportions of C3 and C4 grasses during the past 25,000 years. These data were compared with shifts in pCO2, temperature, moisture balance, and fire to assess how these factors were related to long-term variation of C4 grass abundance during the late Quaternary. At Caledonia Fen, a high-elevation site in the Snowy Mountains, C4 grass abundance decreased from an average of 66 percent during the glacial period to 11 percent during the Holocene, primarily in response to increased pCO2 and temperature. In contrast, this pattern did not exist in low-elevation savannah woodlands around Tower Hill Northwest Crater, where C4 grass abundance instead varied in response to shifts in regional aridity. Fire did not appear to have strongly influenced the proportions of C3 and C4 grasses on the landscape at millennial timescales at either site. These patterns are similar to those of a recent study in East Africa, suggesting that elevation-related climatic differences influence how the abundance of C3 and C4 grasses responds to shifts in climate and pCO2. These results caution against using C4 plant abundance as a proxy indicator of either climate or pCO2 without an adequate understanding of key controlling factors.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Newnham:1990thesis,"This thesis describes the vegetation and climatic changes over the past 20,000 years from pollen records at eight northern New Zealand lowland peat and lake sites, ranging from Taranaki to the Far North. The sites investigated are Umutekai Swamp (Taranaki), Lakes Rotomanuka, Rotokauri, and Okoroire (Waikato), Kopouatai Bog (Hauraki Plains), Lake Waiatarua (Auckland), Otakairangi Swamp (mid-Northland), and Trig Road Swamp (Far North). At sites from Auckland southwards, dating and correlation of the pollen records were enhanced by the occurrence of multiple tephra layers within the pollen-bearing sediments. The clearest picture of regional vegetation history and tightest chronologic control were obtained from the tephra-rich organic lake sediments of the Waikato lowlands. Holocene vegetation changes were broadly consistent throughout this northern New Zealand region and indicate climates, which were initially moist, mild and equable, but became increasingly variable and probably drier overall during the late Holocene. Podocarpangiosperm forest was always prominent and Agathis australis forest expanded throughout the region north of latitude 38° S during the last 6,000 years. Kauri was especially prominent in the Waikato region during the 1000 years or so following the Taupo eruption of c.1800 years ago. At pollen sites from Waikato, Hauraki Plains, and Auckland, palynological evidence suggests that people began clearing forests as early as 800 years ago, but probably not much earlier. Pollen records for the last glacial show less regional uniformity. South of Auckland, scattered tracts of Nothofagus or Libocedrus forest within a shrubland/grassland mosaic were succeeded, between c.14.5 and 10 ka by the regional expansion of podocarp-angiosperm forest, with Prumnopitys taxifolia initially prominent. North of Auckland, the pre-Holocene vegetation history is complicated by uncertain chronologies. Conifer-angiosperm forest with prominent A. austalis grew in the Far North during the last glacial, while in mid-Northland, a substantial period of Nothofagus forest, shrub and grassland communities may correspond to either the entire last glacial or to the late glacial. Local variations in vegetation cover were maintained to some extent independently of regional climate, influenced by site specific factors including edaphic controls, hydroseral succession, and local hydrological changes caused by, e.g., lahar or lava flow, fluvial activity and sea level change. The influence of these local factors is most evident for the late glacial, during which period podocarp-angiosperm forest spread throughout northern New Zealand generally, but with considerable variation in timing even between nearby sites. Fire appears to have been an important factor in vegetation change throughout the period investigated, not just during the human deforestation era; peat swamp communities show a long history of association with fire, while in dryland vegetation, Agathis australis appears to have been especially affected by burning. No unequivocal evidence was found for postglacial latitudinal migrations, but several plants show significant altitudinal range expansions during the last glacial compared with their present distributions in northern New Zealand, viz., Nothofagus menziesii, Libocedrus bidwillii, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, and Halocarpus spp. Thus although vegetation communities at each locality have changed substantially over time, the flora of northern New Zealand remained essentially the same during the c.20,000 years before the human era. Interpretation of the pollen records was assisted by principal components analysis (PCA) and by referring to modern pollen data and pollen-vegetation comparisons obtained from Waipoua Forest, Northland. ...

Newnham:1995bog,"A Holocene history of vegetation, climate, and ombrogenous mire development is presented from pollen and plant macrofossil analyses of sediments at Kopouatai Bog, a large, raised, restiad bog in northern New Zealand. Tephra layers of established ages, supplemented by numerous radiocarbon dates, provide a secure chronology. The earliest peats, overlying last glacial sediments, and dated at c. 11700 radiocarbon years BP, with extensive accumulation after c. 10360 BP, are dominated by pollen of warm temperate podocarp-angiosperm forest, indicating a moist, mild early-Holocene climate. The bog began as a series of small soligenous mires within lowland podocarp-dominated swamp forest but was mostly oligotrophic by c. 8500 BP. Peat accumulation rates have varied spatially and temporally, averaging 0.9 mm yr-1 in central and southern areas. The deposition of deltaic muds in the northern part of the bog accompanied a marine transgression c. 6500-5000 BP, while elsewhere an associated groundwater table rise resulted in a temporary return to mesotrophic conditions. As the marine influence subsequently receded, the northern areas remained subject to regular flooding, but underwent rapid peat growth at a mean rate of 1.7 mm yr-1, while oligotrophic conditions returned to other parts of the bog. Regional vegetation developments indicate a change, c. 6000 BP, to drier, frostier conditions during the late Holocene. Ascarina lucida and Agathis australis may be used as regional pollen- stratigraphic markers for the early Holocene and late Holocene, respectively. The loss of tall trees and expansion of subcanopy species and seral vegetation in forests near Kopouatai Bog, just before the deposition of Kaharoa Tephra (c. 700 BP), are likely evidence for human activity dating from at least this time.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Newnham:1995plenty,"The vegetation history of two mires associated with Holocene dunes near the western Bay of Plenty coast, North Island, New Zealand, is deduced from pollen analysis of two cores. Correlation of airfall tephra layers in the peats, and radiocarbon dates, indicate that the mires at Papamoa and Waihi Beach are c. 4600 and c. 2900 conventional radiocarbon years old, respectively. Tephras used to constrain the chronology of the pollen record include Rotomahana (1886 AD), Kaharoa (700 yr B.P.), Taupo (Unit Y; 1850 yr B.P.), Whakaipo (Unit V; 2700 yr B.P.), Stent (Unit Q; 4000 yr B.P.), Hinemaiaia (Unit K; 4600 yr B.P.), and reworked Whakatane (c. 4800 yr B.P.) at Papamoa, and Kaharoa and Taupo at Waihi Beach. Peat accumulation rates at Papamoa from 4600 - 1850 yr B.P. range from 0.94 to 2.64 mm/yr (mean 1.37 mm/yr). At Waihi Beach, from 2900 yr B.P. - present day, they range from 0.11 to 0.21 mm/yr (mean 0.20 mm/yr). Peat accumulation at both sites was slowest from 1850 to 700 yr B.P., suggesting a drier overall climate during this interval. At both sites, the earliest organic sediments, which are underlain by marine or estuarine sands, yield pollen spectra indicating salt marsh or estuarine environments. Coastal vegetation communities declined at both sites, as sea level gradually fell or the coast prograded, and were eventually superseded by a low moor bog at Papamoa, and a mesotrophic swamp forest at Waihi Beach. These differences, and the marked variation in peat accumulation rates, probably reflect local hydrology and are unlikely to have been climatically controlled. The main regional vegetation during this period was mixed northern conifer-angiosperm forest. Kauri (Agathis australis) formed a minor component of these forests, but populations of this tree have apparently not expanded during the late Holocene at these sites, which are near its present southern limit. Occasional shortlived forest disturbances are detectable in these records, in particular immediately following the deposition of Taupo Tephra. However, evidence for forest clearance during the human era is blurred by the downward dislocation of modern adventive pollen at these sites, preventing the clear differentiation of the Polynesian and European eras.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Newnham:1998kaharoa,"The debate over the timing of arrival and earliest environmental impacts of the first New Zealanders has intensified in recent years, in part fuelled by new evidence or reinterpretation of old evidence from other points along prehistoric Polynesian migratory routes. An examination of two radiocarbon-dated pollen records from northern New Zealand shows how divergent interpretations could be drawn from the same evidence to support both early and late colonization models. Radiocarbon-dated pollen records for deforestation at sites where the risk of contamination by older carbon may be high cannot be used to establish chronologies of settlement. Ombrogenous mires, where peat accumulation proceeds independently of groundwater or surface runoff, are likely to yield the most reliable records. Another solution applicable in northern New Zealand is to base chronologies on tephra layers with reliable age estimates from multiple determinations. Analysis of 11 pollen records currently known to contain the 665&15 bp (c. 600 cal-bp) rhyolitic Kaharoa Tephra demonstrates the critical stratigraphic position that this isochronous surface occupies in New Zealand prehistory. The earliest inferred human impacts occurred at around the time of deposition of the tephra in eight of these sites (73 percent), and well after it at the remainder. These results are in agreement with a later colonization model and suggest that proximity to accessible food resources was more important than climate or latitude in determining early colonization sites. These findings will be tested fully when the known range of Kaharoa Tephra is extended beyond its present limited range through the application of micro-tephra analysis. In line with Anderson's (1995: 128) premise that the later colonization model is eminently falsifiable, we suggest that tephropalynological studies involving the Kaharoa Tephra may hold the key to resolving debates over the timing and spatial patterns of earliest human impact in northern New Zealand.

Delineation of the anthropogenic era, and the distinction between human activity and other agents of environmental change in the pollen/spore diagram, are supported by cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis. Two distinct phases of forest clearance are evident during the pre-European era, reflecting local changes either in population pressure or settlement patterns.

Newnham:2004omapere,"We present an integrated record of environmental change from Lake Omapere, Northland, New Zealand, based on palaeolimnological analysis of a 7-m-long core and eight adjunct cores spanning part of the last 80 calendar (cal.) ka. The chronology was developed using tephrochronology, palaeomagnetism and radiocarbon dating together with climato- and palyno-stratigraphy. Two of 14 tephra layers in the cores provide markers for correlating the record with other New Zealand climato-stratigraphic sequences, deep-sea cores and the global marine isotope record. Pollen, diatom, palaeomagnetic, sedimentologic and pigment analyses show that Lake Omapere, currently f2 m deep, has had a discontinuous history. Occupying a shallow basin perched partly within old basalt lavas, the initial (alkaline) lake formed towards the end of MIS 5a at ca. 80 cal. ka, presumably because of blockage of local drainage of a swampy alluvial floodplain, inundating peat deposits and forest trees, including kauri (Agathis australis). The lake filled rapidly to a level f1--2 m above that at present. Such filling was probably unrelated to climate but a subsequent phase of variable but generally falling lake levels and increasing dystrophy may have been climatically controlled, commencing during MIS 4 and culminating in periods early in MIS 3 when the lake became swampy or dry. Conditions of non-deposition (or non-preservation) obtained for most of the period after ca. 55 cal. ka (Rotoehu Ash) until formation of the modern lake approximately 600--700 cal. years ago or soon after, as indicated by the presence of Tephra-1, identified in part as Kaharoa Tephra (AD 1314), near the top of the core. The modern lake originated possibly through damming of the western outlet as a consequence of accelerated erosion accompanying earliest Polynesian deforestation, an interpretation supported by Maori oral tradition. The pollen record indicates that beech Nothofagus (presumably N. truncata) was much more common in Northland during the Last Glacial, and that for this region the relative abundance of Nothofagus vs. Agathis pollen serves as a better indicator of cooler versus warmer intervals during the Quaternary than the ratio of tree to non-tree pollen. However, it seems likely that moisture balance was a more critical factor than temperature in vegetation composition and distribution, particularly during the LGM, and the long periods of hiatus may also be linked to a drier climate than present. Correlation coefficients between the pollen curves confirm that several tree species (Halocarpus bidwillii, H. biformis and Phyllocladus alpinus), previously palynologically concealed within generic taxonomic groups, occurred about two degrees latitude further north and at a much lower altitude than their current limits during cooler or drier phases of the Last Glacial. A temperature depression in Northland of 4 jC at various times during the Last Glacial is inferred from these range expansions. Nevertheless, the persistence of widespread forest cover suggests that the late Pleistocene climate of Northland was less severe than for most of the rest of New Zealand and strengthens the argument for a heightened temperature gradient across northern New Zealand during the Last Glacial.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Newnham:2007auckland,"Auckland occupies a climatically sensitive position close to a major biogeographic boundary in the southern mid-latitudes. A new pollen record from Kohuora maar crater, Auckland, displays vegetation and climatic changes for the past ca. 32 000 years. Of particular interest are the inferred climatic patterns for the first part of the interval, encompassing the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The Kohuora record corresponds closely with pollen records from other Auckland sites indicating that the patterns observed are at least regional in extent. It is also broadly consistent with a variety of palaeoenvironmental evidence from across New Zealand, including the glacial record from Westland, other palynological records from North Island, other palaeoecological records from the South Island, and aeolian quartz sequences from western North Island. These records show that glacial conditions prevailed across most, if not all, of New Zealand during the interval ca. 29--19 k cal. yr BP, longer and earlier than the LGM sensu stricto. We suggest that the term extended LGM (eLGM) may be more appropriate for the New Zealand region. Within this predominantly cold interval, the Auckland pollen records indicate a climatic amelioration for the interval ca. 26--24 k cal. yr BP, also consistent with other palaeocological data from Canterbury, that fall within a period of climate amelioration recognised between the first two eLGM glacial advances in Westland. We refer to this warming interval as the eLGM Interstadial. The ca. 27 k cal. yr BP Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra is instrumental in most of these inter-site comparisons and occurs after the first peak of eLGM cooling in a short-lived comparatively mild phase. A subsequent return to apparently colder climate in the Auckland records may indicate a volcanic cooling effect or, more likely, widespread landscape disturbance following this major eruption event. Strong correspondence between biotic responses, glacial fluctuations and aeolian quartz deposition linked to major shifts in strength and latitudinal extent of the southern westerlies suggest that both the eLGM and eLGM Interstadial may be more widely registered, at least across the Southern Ocean. Support for this assertion comes from parallel investigations in western and southernmost South America and isotopic and palaeoecological records from Southern Ocean marine cores. Recent reconstructions of the globally averaged ice-equivalent sea-level history are in line with this evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, suggesting that the eLGM may have a global registration. In light of these observations, we suggest a re-examination of the defined timing of the LGM along with renewed effort to establish climatic patterns during this period and understand their causes.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Newnham:2007terrestrial,"A pollen profile from Okarito Pakihi Bog in south Westland, New Zealand extending from near present back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 provides a continuous record of vegetation and climate change for the past two glacial cycles. Independent chronological control was obtained by AMS radiocarbon dating of organic sediments in the upper part of the sequence and OSL dating of inorganic silts in the lower part, with a unique tie point provided by the ca 26.5 cal ka Kawakawa Tephra. As was probably a common occurrence in this region, the basin developed as a moraine-dammed proglacial lake and remained lacustrine until the early Holocene, when a peat bog developed. Survival of the depositional site through subsequent multiple ice advances, unusual in a glaciated landscape. was probably assisted by lateral displacement of the basin relative to its source area, across the Alpine Fault. There is good correspondence between inferred periods of substantial treeline depression in the pollen profile and the record for ice advance in this region. More cooling events are evident in the pollen record. however. presumably due to the fragmentary nature of glacial geomorphology. The pollen record also shows broad consistency with the MIS record and hence with the Milankovitch orbital forcing model, but with some departures, including an early onset to the last glacial maximum (LGM). Several sub-Milankovitch scale events are also evident, including a mid-LGM warming and Lateglacial reversals during both the last and the penultimate deglaciation.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Newnham:2018impact,"Following resolution of a long-standing debate over the timing of the initial settlement of New Zealand from Polynesia (late 13th century), a prevailing paradigm has developed that invokes rapid transformation of the landscape, principally by fire, within a few decades of the first arrivals. This model has been constructed from evidence mostly from southern and eastern regions of New Zealand, but a more complicated pattern may apply in the more humid western and northern regions where forests are more resilient to burning. We present a new pollen record from Lake Pupuke, Auckland, northern New Zealand, that charts the changing vegetation cover over the last 1000 years, before and after the arrival of people. Previous results from this site concurred with the rapid transformation model, although sampling resolution, chronology and sediment disturbance make that interpretation equivocal. Our new record is dated principally by tephrochronology together with radiocarbon dating and includes a cryptotephra deposit identified as Kaharoa tephra, a key marker for first settlement in northern New Zealand. Its discovery and stratigraphic position below two Rangitoto-derived tephras enables a clearer picture of environmental change to be drawn. The new pollen record shows an early phase (step 1) of minor, localised forest clearance around the time of Kaharoa tephra (c. 1314 AD) followed by a later, more extensive deforestation phase (step 2) commencing at around the time of deposition of the Rangitoto tephras (c. 1400--1450 AD). This pattern, which needs to be corroborated from other well-resolved records from northern New Zealand, concurs with an emerging hypothesis that the 'Little Ice Age' had a significant impact on pre-European Māori with the onset of harsher conditions causing a consolidation of populations and later environmental impact in northern New Zealand.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Nichol:2000coastal,"The coastal landscape of New Zealand has been utilized heavily by humans for the last 600 to 800 years, first by Polynesian settlers who disturbed native forests through burning and later by Europeans who continued forest burning and introduced logging and grazing in the mid-19th century. Whangape Harbor and its catchment in Northland, North Island, is an example of a heavily used coastal landscape where the impacts of human use are clearly evident on the deforested and eroding slopes of the catchment, and in the harbor where siltation is contributing to expansion of mangrove forests and a deterioration in the quality and quantity of seafood stocks. This paper documents the physical condition of Whangape Harbor and its catchment and uses sedimentological data (grain size, magnetic susceptibility, pollen) to establish links between sediment sources, pathways, and sinks. Radiocarbon dating of in situ estuarine shells suggests that sedimentation rates in the estuary have increased by an order of magnitude during the period of human occupation. We argue that human impact on Whangape Harbor has caused an acceleration of the natural process of estuary infilling, but has not controlled the type of geomorphic processes operating in the system.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Nichols:2005chagres,"In situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be was measured in 17 sediment samples to estimate the rate and distribution of sediment generation in the upper Río Chagres basin over the last 10 to 20 kyr. Results indicate that the upper Río Chagres basin is generating sediment uniformly. Nuclide activities suggest basin-wide sediment generation rates of 143 and 354 tons/km/yr (avg. = 234 ± 74 tons/km/yr; n = 7) for small tributary basins and 248 to 281 tons/km/yr (avg. = 267 ± 97 tons/km/yr; n = 3) for large tributary basins. The weighted average of all tributaries is 269 ± 63 tons/km/yr; n = 10). A sample collected upstream of Lago Alhajuela suggests that the entire basin is exporting sediment at a rate of 275 ± 62 tons/km/yr. These cosmogenic nuclide measurements all suggest that the upper Río Chagres basin (when considered on scales <5 km2 to >350 km2) is generating sediment at ∼270 tons/km/yr. This long-term (1 −20 kyr) sediment generation rate that is equivalent to the estimate derived from suspended sediment yield measured below the upper Río Chagres- Rió Chico confluence from 1981–96 (289 tons tons/km/yr). Such similarity implies that decadal and millennial sediment yields are similar. Thus, short-term sediment yields and long-term sediment generations are in balance, implying steady landscape behavior over time. The background sediment yield suggests that it would take ∼3,600 years to completely fill Lago Alhajuela, the reservoir for the Panama Canal. Taking into account the present day 2- to 3- fold increase in sediment yields for adjacent human-impacted Rió Boquerón and Rió Pequení basins, the filling time is reduced to ∼2,000 years. However, it would only take between 250 to 600 years to reduce the reservoir capacity (69\% of maximum) enough to drain the entire reservoir for precipitation conditions similar to the 1982 El Niño event. Such models highlight the importance of proper watershed management in order to reduce the sedimentation of Lago Alhajuela.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Without reliable estimates of sediment generation rates and without identification of the sources of sediment delivered to the reef prior to European settlement (c. 1850), determining the necessity and effectiveness of contemporary landscape management efforts is difficult. Here, using the ~ 2100-km2 Barron River catchment in Queensland, Australia, as a test case, we use in situ-produced 10Be to derive sediment generation rate estimates and use in situ and meteoric 10Be to identify the source of that sediment, which enters the Coral Sea near Cairns. Previous model-based calculations suggested that background sediment yields were up to an order of magnitude lower than contemporary sediment yields. In contrast, in situ 10Be data indicate that background (43 t km− 2 y− 1) and contemporary sediment yields (~ 45 t km− 2 y− 1) for the Barron River are similar.

Nicoll:2010cunene,"During geomorphic reconnaissance of the Lower Cunene River near the reach of Serra Cafema, a significant accumulation of Middle Stone Age artifacts was discovered along the Namibia--Angolan border. The archaeological site is downstream of the Marienfluss--Hartmann Valley and lies along the eastern perimeter of the hyperarid Cunene erg (sandsea). Within the study area, the Cunene River is a bedrock anabranching -- mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching system with a morphology that is strongly controlled by lithology and structure and a hydrology dominated by tropical rainfall in the headwaters. A 5 m high alluvial terrace along the left bank of the perennial river is mantled with a surface lag of cobbles and gravels that includes MSA lithics. More than 30 artifacts are preserved in this open-air context. Finds include quartzite flakes, cores, and Levallois--Mousterian points with varying degrees of edge abrasion and varnish; these appear to be the first Levallois--Mousterian points found in this region of Africa. Since the archaeology of this region is poorly known, these cultural assemblages enable initial correlations across southern Africa. A replicate OSL-SAR date ~220 kyr provides initial age constraints on a sand preserved within the cobble-boulder terrace fill, and constrains a maximum age for the overlying archaeological assemblage. This is the first MSA site in northern Namibia in direct stratigraphic context with a securely dated unit. The artifact assemblage underscores the importance of riparian corridors in reconstructing hominin behaviours during the Middle Pleistocene, the time frame marked by the first appearance and the dispersal of the modern human species Homo sapiens.",2023-06-05 10:57:13.636 +0200,

Nobbs:1993petroglyphs,"Exposed surfaces of rock engravings in the Olary Province of South Australia develop coatings of rock varnish, amorphous silica, and oxalate-rich crusts. Instead of relying on any single approach, we use three experimental approaches to assign minimum ages to the petroglyphs. Three methods involve dating manganiferous rock varnish formed over the petroglyphs: 14C measurements of organic matter at the varnish/weathering rind interface provides numerical ages; calibrated ages are obtained by cation-ratio dating; and sequences of layers within varnish are used to discriminate relative ages. A different approach is radiocarbon dating of organic remains within the weathering rind entombed by either rock varnish or amorphous silica. In addition to updating our 1988 results, we report two dozen new radiocarbon ages, eight new cation-ratio ages, and studies of varnish stratigraphy. Although the techniques we use are experimental, our data suggest that petroglyphs have been made in the Olary Province for the last 40,000 radiocarbon years, making its rock art the oldest known in the world. Broader implications of our findings for the cultural history of the Olary Province and for different approaches to dating rock art are explored.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Nobile:2016ambato,"Quantifying denudation rates along orogenic systems is crucial to understand how tectonics and climate interact with each other to create topography. Long-term mean denudation rates estimated from geologic data in the Ambato range (Sierras Pampeanas) is 0.34 mm/yr. When compared with short-term denudation rates from other studies northward and southward along the Argentine South Central Andes foreland, our results are similar to those found in regions with higher mean annual precipitation. Here we utilize concentrations of 10Be cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) in river sediments from catchments along the eastern slope of the Ambato range to understand the relationship among short-term (102–104 yrs) catchment-wide denudation rates and long-term denudation rates estimated from geologic data. CRN denudation rates range between ∼0.038 and ∼0.12 mm/yr. The relationship between geomorphometric parameters (local relief, slope, hypsometric integral, and catchment mean channel steepness index, Ksn) and CRN denudation rates shows linear behavior. The best correlation concerned Ksn indicating a strong connection in the Ambato range between tectonics and denudation. When analyzed together with denudation rates from other studies northward and southward along the South Central Andes foreland, our results are similar to those found in more arid regions and suggest that bedrock strength variations should be contemplated in a regional analysis as well as climate.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here, we review the chronological and archaeological data available for the Kimberley from early Marine Isotope Stage 3 to the present, linking episodes of site establishment and the appearance of new technologies with periods of climatic and sea-level change. We report optical ages showing human occupation of Widgingarri 1, a rockshelter located on the Kimberley coast of northwest Australia, as early as 50,000 years ago, when the site was located more than 100 km from the Late Pleistocene coastline. We also present the first detailed analysis of the stone artefacts, including flakes from ground stone axes, grinding stones and ground haematite recovered from the deepest excavated layer. The high proportion of flakes from ground axe production and resharpening in the earliest occupation phase emphasises the importance of this complex technology in the first peopling of northern Sahul. Artefact analyses indicate changes in settlement patterns through time, with an increase in mobility in the terminal Pleistocene and a shift to lower mobility during the late Holocene.

Norton:2008swiss,"Transient landscape disequilibrium is a common response to climatic fluctuations between glacial and interglacial conditions. Such landscapes are best suited to the investigation of catchment-wide response to changes in incision. The geomorphology of the Trub and Grosse Fontanne, adjacent stream systems in the Napf region of the Swiss Molasse, was analyzed using a 2-m LIDAR DEM. The two catchments were impacted by the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM, even though the glaciers never overrode this region. They did, however, cause base levels to drop by as much as 80 m. Despite their similar tectonic, lithologic and climatic settings, these two basins show very different responses to the changing boundary conditions. Stream profiles in the Trub tend to be smooth, while in the Fontanne, numerous knickzones are visible. Similarly, cut-and-fill terraces are abundant in the Trub watershed, but absent in the Fontanne, where deep valleys have been incised. The Trub appears to be a coupled hillslope–channel system because the morphometrics throughout the basin are uniform. The morphology of hillslopes upstream of the knickzones in the Fontanne is identical to that of the Trub basin, but different downstream of the knickzones, suggesting that the lower reaches of the Fontanne have been decoupled from the hillslopes.

Norton:2010rhone,"Denudation rates of small tributary valleys in the upper Rhone valley of the Swiss Central Alps vary by more than an order of magnitude within a very small distance (tens of kilometers). Morphometric data indicate two distinct erosion processes operate in these steep mountain valleys. We determined the rates of these processes using cosmogenic beryllium‐10 (10Be) in pooled soil and stream sediment samples. Denudation in deep, glacially scoured valleys is characterized by rapid, non‐uniform processes, such as debris flows and rock falls. In these steep valleys denudation rates are 760–2100 mm kyr−1. In those basins which show minimal previous glacial modification denudation rates are low with 60–560 mm kyr−1. The denudation rate in each basin represents a binary mixture between the rapid, non‐uniform processes, and soil creep. The soil production rate measured with cosmogenic 10Be in soil samples averages at 60 mm kyr−1. Mixing calculations suggest that the debris flows and rock falls are occurring at rates up to 3000–7000 mm kyr−1. These very high rates occur in the absence of baselevel lowering, since the tributaries drain into the Rhone trunk stream up‐stream of a knickzone. The flux‐weighted spatial average of denudation rates for the upper Rhone valley is 1400 mm kyr−1, which is similar to rock uplift rates determined in this area from leveling. The pace and location of erosion processes are determined by the oscillation between a glacial and a non‐glacial state, preventing the landscape from reaching equilibrium.

Norton:2011alps,"Denudation rates from cosmogenic 10Be measured in quartz from recent river sediment have previously been used in the Central Alps to argue that rock uplift occurs through isostatic response to erosion in the absence of ongoing convergence. We present new basin-averaged denudation rates from large rivers in the Eastern and Southern European Alps together with a detailed topographic analysis in order to infer the forces driving erosion. Denudation rates in the Eastern and Southern Alps of 170–1,400 mm ky−1 are within a similar range to those in the Central Alps for similar lithologies. However, these denudation rates vary considerably with lithology, and their variability generally increases with steeper landscapes, where correlations with topographic metrics also become poorer. Tertiary igneous rocks are associated with steep hillslopes and channels and low denudation rates, whereas pre-Alpine gneisses usually exhibit steep hillslopes and higher denudation rates. Molasse, flysch, and schists display lower mean basin slopes and channel gradients, and, despite their high erodibility, low erosion rates. Exceptionally low denudation rates are also measured in Permian rhyolite, which has high mean basin slopes. We invoke geomorphic inheritance as a major factor controlling erosion, such that large erosive glaciers in the late Quaternary cold periods were more effective in priming landscapes in the Central Alps for erosion than in the interior Eastern Alps. However, the difference in tectonic evolution of the Eastern and Central Alps potentially adds to differences in their geomorphic response; their deep structures differ significantly and, unlike the Central Alps, the Eastern Alps are affected by ongoing tectonic influx due to the slow motion and rotation of Adria. The result is a complex pattern of high mountain erosion in the Eastern Alps, which has evolved from one confined to the narrow belt of the Tauern Window in late Tertiary time to one affecting the entire underthrust basement, orogenic lid, and parts of the Southern Alps today.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We use numerical meteorological and oceanographic models to determine the origin of a sequence of 29 shore parallel sand beach ridges in northeastern Australia. The results suggest that the ridges were constructed by waves and that the final form or height of the ridges is a function of high-energy tropical cyclone generated waves plus storm tides. Hence these landforms archive a nearly 6000 year long history of intense tropical cyclones. The record implies that these extreme tempests occur considerably more frequently than that suggested by the short historical record for this region. The genesis of this sand beach ridge plain has implications for the interpretation of similar sequences elsewhere along the northeast coast of Australia and in comparable environments globally. If other similar sand beach ridge plains have also been deposited by like processes it stands to reason that these long-term records of high intensity tropical cyclones can be used to ascertain a regional scale risk assessment from this hazard.,2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Nott:2015gaps,"Recent studies of tropical cyclone surge and wave emplaced beach ridge plains have shown that these sequences often contain centennial to millennial scale gaps in their chronologies. Two explanations for the gaps exist — they are due to erosion, or alternatively a cessation or substantial slowing of depositional processes suggestive of a quieter phase in intense storm activity. Differentiating between the two is important for uncovering reliable long-term storm histories from these sequences. We use landform morphology, sediment texture and luminescence chronology to determine the origin of substantial chronological gaps in a plain containing more than 100 shore-parallel ridges composed of fine-grained sand located in northeast Australia. We identify and describe the characteristics associated with both erosional and non-erosional gaps. The erosional gaps are associated with changes in orientation between ridge sets and often a high ridge with hummocky topography that appears to have been disturbed by aeolian activity. River floods likely caused the partial erosion of ridge sets. Non-erosional gaps do not display these morphological characteristics and are likely associated with quiescence in severe tropical cyclone activity. These geomorphic and chronological signatures can be used to identify different sorts of gaps in other ridge plains and are an important tool in the reconstruction of long-term storm histories from these coastal landforms. The data also suggests that fine-grained ridges can, like their coarse-grained counterparts, be predominantly deposited by storm waves and surge and their texture need not necessarily be indicative of the processes responsible for ridge development.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

This questioning derives from: the interpretation that this hearth of agriculture does not appear to have lead to exponentially expanding populations prone to a pressure to disperse in search of more land (Harris, 2002), but, rather, archaeological and palaeoecological examinations of the site lend to an interpretation of periodic intensification leading to environmental degradation which fuelled technological innovation thus spurring continued degradation within relative spatial confinement.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Ogden:1998regeneration,"New Zealand forests burn less frequently than tussock grasslands, heath or shrublands. Species composition, past disturbance and stand condition determine inflammability and fuel load, and consequent fire intensity and spatial extent. Before people arrived, fores were ignited by lightning during drought years on the eastern sides of both islands. Volcanism occurring every 300±600 years was associated with fires in the central North Island. A review of radiocarbon-dated charcoal from the eastern South Island, and of evidence for fire in pollen profiles from the North Island, provide the basis for an assessment of fire frequency. Forest fires have occurred on both New Zealand's islands throughout the Holocene at least every few centuries, until the last millennium when frequency increased. The 'return time' of fire at any one place in the forested landscape was probably one or two millennia. Burned areas usually succeeded to forest again before the next inflagration. Consequently fire adaptation is infrequent in the New Zealand flora, and Polynesian forest clearance was rapid and largely permanent. There is an indication of an increase in fire frequency in the late Holocene, and a clear signal associated with people approx. 700 years BP.

Ogden:2001murray,"Dates for sediment deposition have been obtained for a number of abandoned channels with modern features on the Upper Murray, Kiewa, Ovens and Goulburn Rivers, and from palaeochannel deposits on the Upper Murray River just west of Albury. The dates from modern channels on the Upper Murray are problematic, but suggest modern fluvial activity had begun by 5–9ka. Two dates from the Ovens and Kiewa Rivers are in agreement with this. West of Albury, a palaeochannel point bar returned an age of 7.411.6ka, and a source bordering sand dune ∼22.5ka. Sand beneath the floodplain near Albury was aged 7.3ka, and was not deposited at the same time as underlying gravels, where two embedded trees returned ages of 12ka. It therefore cannot be established if the sand deposit was associated with either modern or palaeochannel activity. Therefore, on the Upper Murray River the transition from palaeochannel to modern fluvial activity most likely occurred between 7 and 10ka. In contrast, two dates from an abandoned channel on the Goulburn River indicates that modern channels were active on this river before 11–13ka. This suggests that palaeochannels were active later on the Upper Murray than on the Goulburn River, and compared with previous work, possibly later than on the Murrumbidgee River and the middle Murray River near Echuca. As upper catchment areas were revegetated following the LGM, discharge or sediment supply may have declined first in lower altitude catchments, like the Goulburn, and last in the high-altitude Upper Murray catchment, creating an asynchronous transition from palaeochannel to modern fluvial activity in subcatchments of the southeast Murray drainage basin.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Vegetation plots and dendrochronological studies of trees on the clearing margins date the cessation of burning and subsequent invasion by woody plants. The radiocarbon and palynological results indicate that the clearing was created by fire ca. AD 1460. Although people were probably present to windward in the Waipoua valley before this time, they left no palynological signature at the study site. The date for the formation of the clearing agrees with others indicating population increase at this time, and with oral tradition for the arrival in the Waipoua valley of Manumanu 1, the ancestor of Te Iwi O Te Roroa. The maintenance of the clearing in seral vegetation by fire for >300 years supports the tradition that it was used as a kiwi (Apterix australis) hunting site. During the period of European contact, fire intensity appears to have declined, while fire frequency may have increased, favouring the spread of bracken (rahurahu, Pteridium esculentum), an important food source. Intentional firing probably ceased ca. 1900, by which time the local Maori population was in decline and European gum-diggers were camped in the clearing. The postulated sequence of formation, use and abandonment of the clearing requires confirmation by investigation of similar nearby sites using the same combination of methods.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Ojha:2019nepal,"The Himalayas stretch ∼3000 km along the Indo-Eurasian plate boundary. Along-strike variations in the fault geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) have given rise to significant variations in the topographic steepness, exhumation rate, and orographic precipitation along the Himalayan front. Over the past 2 decades, the rates and patterns of Himalayan denudation have been documented through numerous cosmogenic nuclide measurements in central and eastern Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. To date, however, few denudation rates have been measured in Far Western Nepal, a ∼300 km wide region near the center of the Himalayan arc, which presents a significant gap in our understanding of Himalayan denudation. Here we report new catchment-averaged millennial-scale denudation rates inferred from cosmogenic 10Be in fluvial quartz at seven sites in Far Western Nepal. The inferred denudation rates range from 385±31 t km−2 yr−1 (0.15±0.01 mm yr−1) to 8737±2908 t km−2 yr−1 (3.3±1.1 mm yr−1) and, in combination with our analyses of channel topography, are broadly consistent with previously published relationships between catchment-averaged denudation rates and normalized channel steepness across the Himalaya. These data show that the denudation rate patterns in Far Western Nepal are consistent with those observed in central and eastern Nepal. The denudation rate estimates from Far Western Nepal show a weak correlation with catchment-averaged specific stream power, consistent with a Himalaya-wide compilation of previously published stream power values. Together, these observations are consistent with a dependence of denudation rate on both tectonic and climatic forcings, and they represent a first step toward filling an important gap in denudation rate measurements in Far Western Nepal.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Olen:2015arun,"Understanding the rates and pattern of erosion is a key aspect of deciphering the impacts of climate and tectonics on landscape evolution. Denudation rates derived from terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCNs) are commonly used to quantify erosion and bridge tectonic (Myr) and climatic (up to several kiloyears) time scales. However, how the processes of erosion in active orogens are ultimately reflected in 10Be TCN samples remains a topic of discussion. We investigate this problem in the Arun Valley of eastern Nepal with 34 new 10Be‐derived catchment‐mean denudation rates. The Arun Valley is characterized by steep north‐south gradients in topography and climate. Locally, denudation rates increase northward, from <0.2 mm yr−1 to ~1.5 mm yr−1 in tributary samples, while main stem samples appear to increase downstream from ~0.2 mm yr−1 at the border with Tibet to 0.91 mm yr−1 in the foreland. Denudation rates most strongly correlate with normalized channel steepness (R 2 = 0.67), which has been commonly interpreted to indicate tectonic activity. Significant downstream decrease of 10Be concentration in the main stem Arun suggests that upstream sediment grains are fining to the point that they are operationally excluded from the processed sample. This results in 10Be concentrations and denudation rates that do not uniformly represent the upstream catchment area. We observe strong impacts on 10Be concentrations from local, nonfluvial geomorphic processes, such as glaciation and landsliding coinciding with areas of peak rainfall rates, pointing toward climatic modulation of predominantly tectonically driven denudation rates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In addition, we perform topographic analyses to assess the contribution of vegetation and climate in modulating denudation rates along strike.

Oliver:2014robust,"Accurate chronologies are fundamental for detailed analysis of palaeoenvironmental conditions, archaeological reconstructions and investigations of Holocene coastal morphological changes. Chronological data enable estimation of rates of shoreline progradation, and provide appropriate context for forecasting future coastal changes. A previously reported radiocarbon chronology for the Moruya coastal plain in south-eastern Australia indicated a decelerating overall rate of progradation with minimal net seaward shoreline movement in the past ~2500 years. Single-grain and multi-grain aliquot optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) analyses demonstrate that marine sands from this region have excellent luminescence characteristics. A series of OSL ages across this coastal barrier indicates a remarkably linear trend of Holocene shoreline progradation. The linear trend of seaward shoreline movement indicates that the barrier has grown at an average rate of 0.27 m/yr with successive ridge formation every ~110 years. The oldest ridge on the barrier appears to correspond to cessation of rapid post-glacial sea-level rise, and the large foredune at the seaward margin of the barrier is <400 years old. The contrast between the existing radiocarbon chronology and the OSL ages reported in this study implies the need for a more cautious interpretation of coastal barrier chronologies, in Australia and around the world, where they have been based on radiocarbon dating of shell hash.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Such reconstructions benefit from new techniques and technologies now available in coastal studies. This study investigated the Callala Beach prograded barrier deposit situated within Jervis Bay on the NSW south coast. This prograded barrier, composed of a series of low-relief, shore-parallel ridges, formed after sea level stabilised on this coastline in the mid Holocene. The approach involved analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) topographic data, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) collection and processing, and dating of ridge deposits using the optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating technique. These data sets demonstrate that the most landward ridge of the Callala Beach barrier was deposited ~7500 years ago, closely aligning with the best estimates for the timing of sea-level stabilisation in southeastern Australia. Progradation continued throughout the late Holocene at a steady rate of ~0.1 m/yr until near the present time, as shown by an age of ~400 years immediately behind the modern foredune. GPR-imaged subsurface structures captured the beachface and dune facies; a regular series of reflectors indicated incremental accumulations of sediment over the late Holocene. Volumes of sand accumulated during barrier growth indicated an average sediment supply for the entire embayment of ~1600 m3/yr or ~0.3 m3/yr per metre of beach.

Technologies such as airborne LiDAR, ground penetrating radar (GPR) and optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL) were utilised at Boydtown and Wonboyn, in southeastern Australia, and combined with previously reported radiocarbon dates and offshore seismic and sedimentological data to reconstruct the morpho-sedimentary history of prograded barrier systems. These technologies enabled reconstruction of geological timescale processes integrated with an inter-decadal model of ridge formation explaining the GPR-imaged subsurface character of the barriers.

Oliver:2017punctuated,"Prograded barriers are depositional coastal landforms which preserve past shoreline locations and have been studied in order to understand the fundamental drivers of barrier formation. This paper reconstructs the Holocene history of the Seven Mile Beach, prograded barrier in Tasmania, Australia using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, ground penetrating radar (GPR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR) elevation models and sedimentological analyses. Shoreline progradation of the barrier commenced around 7300 years ago and continued to near present despite a ~ 3000 pause in deposition between 6700 and 3600 years ago indicative of substantial changes in sediment availability. GPR imaged subsurface structures contain a record of seaward dipping reflectors preserved as sediment supplied beaches and dunes leading to shoreline progradation. In the past 500 years a large transgressive dune has formed, built from reworked barrier sands, and now dominates the eastern portion of the barrier implying that shoreline progradation has ceased. This study reaffirms the notion that relict foredune ridges are strongly aligned with modal wave refraction patterns in planform and emphasises the importance of sediment delivery as a key driver of shoreline progradation through beachface and dune accretion. The substantial pause in shoreline progradation on this barrier system, as observed on others around the world, requires further explanation. Although changes in sediment delivery have been inferred, it may also be appropriate to reopen the debate on Holocene sea-level change in Tasmania.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Oliver:2018pedro,"At Pedro Beach on the southeastern coast of Australia a series of foredune ridges provides an opportunity to explore the morphodynamic paradigm as it applies to coastal barrier systems using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, ground penetrating radar (GPR) and airborne LiDAR topography. A series of sandy dune-capped ridges, increasing in height seawards, formed from c. 7000 years ago to c. 3900 years ago. During this time the shoreline straightened as the embayment filled and accommodation space for Holocene sediments diminished. Calculation of Holocene sediment accumulation above mean sea level utilising airborne LiDAR topography shows a decline in average sediment supply over this time period coupled with a decrease in shoreline progradation rate from 1.2 m/yr to 0.38 m/yr. The average ridge 'exposure lifetime' during this period increases resulting in higher ridges as dune-forming processes have longer to operate. Increasing exposure to wave and wind energy also appears to have resulted in higher ridges as the sheltering effect of marginal headlands was diminished. An inherited disequilibrium shoreface profile will drive onshore accumulation of sandy sediments forming a prograded barrier; however, if there is no longer 'accommodation space' for sediment, this will be an overriding factor causing the cessation of progradation, as occurred c. 3900 years ago at Pedro Beach. Excess sediment in the nearshore zone after 3900 years ago may have been moved northward to nourish downdrift beaches in the compartment. A high outer foredune has formed through vertical accretion after 500 years ago, evidenced by GPR subsurface structures and OSL ages, with a distinct period of vertical and lee slope accretion and dated to the period 1890-1930 AD.

Oliver:2018signatures,"Regressive barriers persisting in the landscape over interglacial-glacial cycles are important repositories of paleoclimatic signatures such as past sea level and regional aridity. The Gippsland region of Victoria contains a multi-barrier system formed during past interglacial-glacial cycles and the late-Holocene. An extensive series of parallel foredune ridges forming the elongate inner barrier was sampled for luminescence dating with ages indicating deposition ca.125,000-108,000 years ago coinciding with the later phase of the Last Interglacial (LIG) Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e and the transition to MIS 5d. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) imaged beach-face reflectors within the LIG barrier indicate that sea level was within -2 to +3 m of present level during MIS 5e in this far-field location. Significant reworking of the barrier system through blowout and parabolic dune activity occurred between 23,000-18,000 years ago corresponding to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with an estimated 160,000,000 m3 of coastal sediments eroded and redistributed. The morphological changes to this coastal barrier over the most recent interglacial-glacial cycle (MIS 5e to present) also imply significant landscape instability during the LGM in southeastern Australia and are further evidence for extension of the geographical range and intensity of aridity at this time.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Oliver:2019guichen,"Prograded barrier systems record shoreline behaviour and palaeoenvironmental information. The Guichen Bay Holocene embayment fill succession in South Australia has been subject to several prominent studies; however, several important unanswered questions remained regarding the timing of the older ridge sets at this site. Additional Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating indicates that progradation commenced in the southeastern corner of the plain ~7300 years ago and was rapid between ~5800 and ~5000 years ago. To augment this record, three OSL dating transects were constructed at nearby Rivoli Bay in the north, central and south. Rapid progradation occurred in the south and then north of the Rivoli plain until ~5000 years ago. Steady progradation occurred in the centre of the plain between ~5000 years ago and present. Rapid shoreline progradation at Guichen and Rivoli Bays before ~5000 years ago was due to the input of sediment from the erosion of Robe and Woakwine Ranges and the inner continental shelf as sea levels rose to present. Raised beach strata imaged with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at Rivoli Bay suggest a sea-level highstand of +2 m above present ~3500 years ago, steadily falling and reaching the present ~1000 years ago. This concurs with evidence from Guichen Bay and may have promoted shoreline progradation. Sediment infilling of Guichen and Rivoli Bays and the fall in sea level restricted the marine corridor between the Woakwine and Robe Ranges to a narrow channel by ~4000 and ~2000 years in the north and south, respectively.

Oliver:2021accreting,"Coastal ridge plains represent a valuable record of past shoreline deposition. However, there remain questions regarding shoreline behavior on intermediate timescales (sub-centennial), the impact of storms, and process of ridge genesis. We address these questions through high-resolution reconstruction of the sandy-beach progradation at Boydtown Beach in Twofold Bay, southeastern Australia, over the past 1000 years using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. GPR profiles are dominated by seaward-dipping reflections that result from beach and dune progradation. Prominent reflections with heavy-mineral concentrations are also preserved resulting from storm erosion. OSL ages reveal alternative phases of steady and episodic accretion, rather than a constant progradation. We hypothesize that steady phases may result from moderate storm events where each successive storm only partially erodes the recovery of the previous event. This results in incremental seaward accretion of the active beach. Phases of episodic accretion could be the result of larger storm events or storm clusters when large post-storm recovery rapidly shifts the active shoreline seaward. The two modes of shoreline progradation (steady and episodic) appear broadly associated with a change in ridge-and-swale morphology whereby subdued ridge swale topography is associated with steady or incremental progradation and higher, better-defined ridges with episodic accretion. These results suggest that a single coastal ridge plain experiences variable intermediate-scale shoreline behavior in response to storm events which then lead to multiple modes of ridge genesis.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Twofold Bay on the New South Wales south coast, Australia, contains four main beaches (Aslings, Boydtown, Whale and Fisheries Beaches) and associated barrier systems. We present a range of existing geological and geomorphic information combined with new field data which demonstrate considerable variation in the Holocene evolution and sediment budget of these adjacent beaches. These data show three broad sediment types exist within Twofold Bay and its beach systems: Type 1 is a mature quartz-rich sand derived from the shelf.

Oliver:2022tasmania,"Two barrier systems in southeastern Tasmania afford the opportunity to contrast Holocene barrier evolution and explore large-scale coastal morphodynamics under consistent regional-scale boundary conditions on an embayed wave-dominated coastline. New Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) ages for the previously undated seaward ridges of Seven Mile Beach constrain the deposition of the foredune ridges over the past ~1000 years indicating continued shoreline progradation at ~0.4 m/yr. A further 13 OSL ages collected from the foredune ridges of Nine Mile Beach barrier detail the evolution of this barrier system and indicate progradation commenced approximately ~8500 years ago. Following this, a steady rate of shoreline advance at 0.14 m/yr was evident to near present-day with one phase of rapid accretion ~5000 years ago. This occurred as the barrier system extended eastward to span the full embayment width which resulted in the redirection of the estuarine channel and the subsequent erosion of previously deposited ridges due to channel migration likely over several thousand years. The eroded sediment may have contributed to ongoing positive sand budget in the embayment and continued shoreline progradation. Barrier 'recycling' was also suggested as a potential driver of progradation at Seven Mile Beach based on the truncated margin of the landward ridges. However, at both sites, the dynamics of possible sediment exchange between the back-barrier and open shoreline requires further detailed modelling. The relatively small river systems in this region supply minimal sand to the coast at these sites, however, there is some minor alongshore sediment supply along the western margin of these deep embayment's.

In this framework, we combined river longitudinal profile analysis with hillslope erosion rates calculated by 10Be content in modern fluvial sediments to reconstruct the long‐term uplift history of the massif. Cosmogenic data show a large variation in erosion rates, marking two main domains. The samples collected in the high‐standing low‐relief surface atop Sila provide low erosion rates (from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 0.13 ± 0.01 mm/yr). Conversely, high values of erosion rate (up to 0.92 ± 0.08 mm/yr) characterize the incised fluvial valleys on the massif flanks. The analyzed river profiles exhibit a wide range of shapes diverging from the commonly accepted equilibrium concave‐up form. Generally, the studied river profiles show two or, more frequently, three concave‐up segments bounded by knickpoints and characterized by different values of concavity and steepness indices.

Olivetti:2016massif,"The French Massif Central is a part of the Hercynian orogenic belt that currently exhibits anomalously high topography. The Alpine orogenesis, which deeply marked Western European topography, involved only marginally the Massif Central, where Cenozoic faulting and short-wavelength crustal deformation is limited to the Oligocene rifting. For this reason the French Massif Central is a key site to study short- and long-term topographic response in a framework of slow tectonic activity. In particular the origin of the Massif Central topography is a topical issue still debated, where the role of mantle upwelling is invoked by different authors. Here we present a landscape analysis using denudation rates derived from basin-averaged cosmogenic nuclide concentrations coupled with longitudinal river profile analysis. This analysis allows us to recognize that the topography of the French Massif Central is not fully equilibrated with the present base level and in transient state. Our data highlight the coexistence of out-of-equilibrium river profiles, incised valleys, and low cosmogenically derived denudation rates ranging between 40 mm/kyr and 80 mm/kyr. Addressing this apparent inconsistency requires investigating the parameters that may govern erosion processes under conditions of reduced active tectonics.

The precision and accuracy of the technique, which has the potential to date sediments deposited during the last 500,000 years or so, is limited by the random and systematic uncertainties associated with producing optical ages. These result in total relative age uncertainties of between 10% and 20% at the 68% confidence interval, which are similar in size to those associated with Late Quaternary oxygen-isotope chronologies. We analysed single grains of quartz from several depth intervals down core Fr10/95-GC17, which was collected offshore from Cape Range Peninsula, Western Australia, from a water depth of 1093 m in the eastern Indian Ocean. The single-grain optical ages are shown to be consistent with AMS radiocarbon ages obtained from planktonic foraminifera from the same core. We also show that marine sediments are not immune from partial or heterogeneous bleaching (incomplete resetting) of the optical dating signal.

For 12 samples of known (independent) age, we show that application of a 'minimum age model' to the single-grain and 'small' (10-grain) aliquot De data provides the most accurate estimate of the burial dose for nine of the samples examined (3 aeolian, 5 fluvial, and 1 marine). The weighted mean De (as obtained using the 'central age model') gives rise to burial age overestimates of up to a factor of 10 for these nine samples, whether single grains, small aliquots, or 'large' (100-grain) aliquots are used. For the other three samples (two aeolian and one fluvial), application of either the minimum age model or the central age model to the single-grain, small aliquot, and large aliquot De data yields burial ages in accord with the independent age control. We infer that these three samples were well bleached at the time of deposition.

Olley:2006grave,"Recent age constraints on Australia's oldest human remains (Mungo I and III), found at Lake Mungo in western New South Wales, relied on optical dating of sands from the same stratigraphic units as those into which the remains had been inserted (42±3ka) and those that overlay the graves (38±2ka), giving a burial age of 40±2ka. This indirect means of dating the burials was necessary because the original site from which the remains had been excavated had been completely eroded away. At the time of the original excavation of the Mungo III grave, blocks of sediment from the grave-infill were collected for sediment fabric analysis. These sediment blocks were impregnated with polyester resin, sectioned for analysis and the remaining resin-impregnated sediment blocks were then stored in a cupboard, where they have lain for the last 30 years. Here we report on optical dating of single grains of quartz extracted from one of these sediment blocks. Grains extracted from the centre of the block show a wide distribution of equivalent doses (0.0±0.3 to 43.7±8.3Gy), indicating that not all of the grains have remained hidden from light (light-safe) following excavation. We show that the population of grains with the maximum equivalent dose produces an age consistent with that of the previous study, indicating that some of the grains have remained light-safe. We also use linearly modulated optically stimulated luminescence to identify light-safe grains. These yield an age of 41±4ka, which represents a direct optical age for the grave-infill and which is consistent with the age obtained in the previous study for sands from the same stratigraphic unit as that containing the burial.

Orem:2016caldera,"Wildfires can dramatically increase erosion rates over time scales on the order of several years, yet few data firmly constrain the relative importance of post‐wildfire erosion in the long‐term denudation of landscapes.

We found that following the Las Conchas fire in 2011, mean watershed‐averaged erosion rates were more than 1000 µm yr−1, i.e., ~103–105 times higher than nearby unburned watersheds of similar area, relief, and lithology. Long‐term denudation rates are on the order of 10–100 µm yr−1. Combining data for wildfire‐affected and non‐wildfire‐affected erosion rates into a long‐term denudation rate budget, we found that wildfire‐affected erosion is responsible for at least 90\% of denudation over geologic time scales in our study area despite the fact that such conditions occur only at a small fraction of the time.

Oskin:2017vallecito,"Rates of erosion over time provide a valuable tool for gauging tectonic and climatic drivers of landscape evolution. Here, we measure 10Be archived in quartz sediment from the Fish Creek-Vallecito basin to resolve a time-series of catchment averaged erosion rates and to test the hypothesis that aridity and increased climate variation after ca. 3 Ma led to an increase in erosion rates in this semi-arid, ice-free setting. The Fish Creek-Vallecito basin, located east of the Peninsular Ranges in southern California, is an ideal setting to derive a Plio-Pleistocene paleo-erosion rate record. The basin has a rapid sediment accumulation rate, a detailed magnetostratigraphic age record, and its stratigraphy has been exposed through recent, rapid uplift and erosion. A well-defined source region of uniform lithology and low erosion rate provides a high, reproducible 10Be signal. We find that paleo-erosion rates were remarkably consistent between 1 and 4 Ma, averaging 38 ± 24 m/Myr (2σ). Modern catchment averaged erosion rates are similar to the paleo-erosion rates. The uniformity of erosion over the past 4 Myr indicates the landscape was not significantly affected by late Pliocene global climate change, nor was it affected by a local long-term increase in aridity.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Ott:2019greece,"On Crete—as is common elsewhere in the Mediterranean—carbonate massifs form high mountain ranges whereas topography is lower in areas with meta‐clastic rocks. This observation suggests that differences in denudational processes between carbonate‐rich rocks and quartzofeldspathic units impart a fundamental control on landscape evolution. Here we present new cosmogenic basin‐average denudation rate measurements from both 10Be and 36Cl in meta‐clastic and carbonate bedrock catchments, respectively, to assess relationships between denudation rates, processes, and topographic form. We compare total denudation rates to dissolution rates calculated from 49 new and previously published water samples. Basin‐average denudation rates of meta‐clastic and carbonate catchments are similar, with mean values of ~0.10 mm/a and ~0.13 mm/a, respectively. The contribution of dissolution to total denudation rate was <10\% in the one measured meta‐clastic catchment, and ~40\% for carbonate catchments (~0.05 mm/a), suggesting the dominance of physical over chemical weathering at the catchment scale in both rock types. Water mass‐balance calculations for three carbonate catchments suggests 40–90\% of surface runoff is lost to groundwater. To explore the impact of dissolution and infiltration to groundwater on relief, we develop a numerical model for carbonate denudation. We find that dissolution modifies the river profile channel steepness, and infiltration changes the fluvial response time to external forcing. Furthermore, we show that infiltration of surface runoff to groundwater in karst regions is an efficient way to steepen topography and generate the dramatic relief in carbonates observed throughout Crete and the Mediterranean.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

To date, however, few data sets show the dynamic range of both these relationships needed to test theoretical models of hillslope evolution and river incision. Here, we utilize concentrations of 10Be in quartz extracted from river sand on the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau to explore relationships among short-term (102–105 a) erosion rate, hillslope gradient, and channel steepness. Our data illustrate nonlinear behavior and a threshold in the relationship between erosion rate and mean hillslope gradient, confirming the generalization that hillslopes around the world are limited by slope stability and cease to provide a metric for erosion at high rates (>~0.2 mm/a). The relationship between channel steepness index and erosion rate is also nonlinear, but channels continue to steepen beyond the point where threshold hillslopes emerge up to at least 0.6 mm/a, demonstrating that channel steepness is a more reliable topographic metric than mean hillslope gradient for erosion rate and that channels ultimately drive landscape adjustment to increasing rates of base-level fall in tectonically active settings.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Local tectonism on the southern part of the plain confuses an interpretation of riverine response to changing Pleistocene climate. TL dates show that drainage diversion in response to tectonic movement along the Cadell Fault near Echuca began as early as 60Ka but that the damming of the Goulburn River to produce Lake Kanyapella did not occur until about 30Ka.

On the basis of stratigraphic information the channels reveal a picture of changing flow conditions during the last full glacial cycle. The ages of the periods were determined from nearly 40 thermoluminescence dates on surficial fluvial and aeolian sediments. These are named the Coleambally phase, which occurred from 105 to 80 ka (the mid- to latter part of Oxygen Isotope Stage 5), the Kerarbury phase from 55 to 35 ka (Stage 3), the Gum Creek phase from 35 to 25 ka (late Stage 3 to early Stage 2) and the Yanco phase from 20 to 13 ka (late Stage 2). The present flow regime was established by about 12 ka (Stage 1). The first two phases correlate with episodes of enhanced fluvial activity in northern and central Australia and with reduced dust activity globally. The phases in Stage 2 appear to be associated with seasonal snow melt and increased peak flows in periods flanking the Last Glacial Maximum. Source-bordering aeolian dunes associated with the Coleambally, Kerarbury and Yanco phases were found, however, the TL dates show that some have undergone aeolian reworking.

Page:2007gilmore,"European settlement in southeastern Australia led to rapid changes in the morphology of many upland streams. However, our knowledge of the nature of these changes is limited as historical records and preserved palaeochannels are rare. In this study we compare a well-preserved section of the late Holocene palaeochannel of Gilmore Creek to its present channel. We used a combination of map and aerial photograph interpretation, field survey, OSL dating and discharge analysis to describe and compare the modern and palaeochannels and establish a firm date for the timing of channel change. In common with many other streams in southeastern Australia Gilmore Creek's late Holocene channel meandered across a stable well-vegetated and frequently inundated floodplain. After about 1830 European settlers quickly modified the catchment by clearing riparian and hillslope vegetation, introducing grazing animals and other exotic species and mining for alluvial gold in the headwaters. The OSL dates show that between about 1850 and 1880 the small meandering channel aggraded with coarse sands and then up to about 1 m of silty sand was deposited over the floodplain. Declining sediment input from upstream channel avulsion before 1890 resulted in the establishment of a straighter, larger capacity channel that incised to the level of basal cobbles and, in places, to bedrock. The dramatic change in channel pattern resembles that described on the Cann River in eastern Victoria following the removal of riparian vegetation and within-channel coarse woody debris. At Gilmore Creek increased channel capacity has greatly reduced the average frequency of floodplain inundation. High values of specific stream power suggest that channel morphology is now well adjusted to the present flow regime.

Palumbo:2010control,"Fault-bounded mountain ranges with along-strike variations in mean slope angle and local relief offer the opportunity to investigate how denudation depends on these topographic parameters. We determined catchment-wide denudation rates along two actively growing, fault-bounded mountain ranges (the Yumu and western Longshou Shan) from 10Be concentrations in quartz from stream sediments. Both ranges expose (1) low-grade metamorphic Paleozoic rocks in their center, and (2) unmetamorphosed Cretaceous red beds near the tips of the range-bounding thrust faults. Field observations document debris flows, shallow landsliding, and surface wash as dominant mechanisms of mass transport on the hillslopes. Denudation rates obtained for the Paleozoic metasediments range from ∼ 100 to ∼ 300 mm ka− 1 and correlate linearly with mean slope angle and local relief. In contrast, Cretaceous sediments exhibit mainly higher and more variable denudation rates between ∼ 30 and ∼ 500 mm ka− 1, although slope and relief values are lower for these catchments. The higher denudation rates in the Cretaceous red beds are interpreted as resulting from their lower mechanical strength as compared to the resistant Paleozoic rocks. This important lithologic control on denudation demonstrates that uniform catchment lithologies and rock strength are essential for deciphering the effect of topographic indices on the rate of denudation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Denudation rates for catchments with mean hillslope angles steeper than ∼25° range from ∼100 to ∼800 mm ka−1. Field observations suggest that these higher and more variable rates are the result of erosion by bedrock landslides, which contribute to mass transport on the hillslopes. Six catchments aligned along the mountain front of the central Qilian Shan have reached threshold values of slope and relief.

Parr:2009human,"Prehistoric land use and social activity in West New Britain, PNG, are well documented, although the landscapes – largely shaped by catastrophic volcanic eruptions – in which these took place, and the relationships people had with these landscapes, are poorly understood. We define the evolving landscape at Numundo, from prior to the Witori-Kimbe 2 eruption (W-K2, ca. 3600 BP) to after the Witori-Kimbe 4 eruption (W-K4, ca. 1400 BP), using fossil phytolith and coral evidence at eight archaeological sites to provide environmental evidence of the human responses to periodic catastrophic events. From ca. 5900 to 3600 BP, all the sites were coastal and disturbed. Early disturbance reflected natural forest recovery after W-K1 (ca. 5900 BP), whereas the later landscape was largely shaped by human activity. In contrast, forest regrowth was limited after W-K2 and open environments typical of human activity with a mosaic of regenerating, disturbed and managed vegetation, persisted until W-K3. Environmental recovery from W-K3 and W-K4 (ca. 1700 BP and ca. 1400 BP) differed completely, reflecting severity of the volcanism and the short time between eruptions. The landscape after W-K3 was largely a naturally recovering landscape, in contrast to effective vegetation recovery and significant human exploitation of the landscape – again a mosaic of regenerating, disturbed and managed vegetation – after W-K4. The social history is one in which people evolved increasingly flexible land-use practices, enabling them to re-settle this periodically disrupted landscape, and to take advantage of an increasingly broad range of habitats suitable for cultivation. The human response to this highly dynamic landscape represents a close relationship between social and natural processes, as people became increasingly better at re-settling an unpredictably disrupted landscape; both the social and environmental processes within this landscape become equally influential and instrumental in shaping the effects of the other.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Pasveer:2002pleistocene,"This paper reports new AMS dates for Late Pleistocene occupation of the Ayamaru Plateau in the central Bird‘s Head of Papua. Two cave sites, Kria Cave and Toe Cave, together provide occupation sequences that span the Holocene and extend back to the Last Glacial Maximum. The associated faunal remains suggest that this lowland area has supported continuous rainforest cover throughout the entire period of occupation. During the Last Glacial Maximum a suite of montane mammal species extended their altitudinal range down onto the plateau, some persisting locally until around 6000 BP. While the Late Pleistocene age of the basal deposit in Toe Cave was previously suggested, new AMS radiocarbon dates on Casuarius eggshell confirm occupation from 24,000 cal BP. Amino acid racemisation data paired with the AMS dates, provide additional support for the improved chronology. The new dates indicate consistent human exploitation of lowland rainforest environments in a relatively rugged and remote region of the central Bird‘s Head.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Patton:1993ross,"The rivers of central Australia rise in the MacDonnell Ranges and flow out across broad, low-relief plains into the surrounding desert. The stratigraphy of the Ross River plain records the areal extent and frequency of Holocene floods. This floodout plain is underlain by deeply weathered alluvial deposits, characterized by red earth soils dated by thermoluminesence at >59,000 yr. This old alluvium is covered by a sheet-like deposit of very silty sand of probable eolian origin dated by thermoluminesence at 9200 ± 900 yr. The oldest Holocene alluvium occurs as broad, low-relief bars and levee deposits flanking the modem channel and as low-relief long-wavelength bedforms that fan out across the plain. This deposit resulted from a flood flow, up to 10 km wide, that covered the entire plain. Evidence for several large floods between 1500 and 700 yr B.P. is also preserved in a 500- to 1500-m-wide paleochannel. Thus, the surface features on the floodout plains are the product of a few rare large flood events.

Patton:2022measuring,"The concept of the geomorphic cycle is a foundational principle in geology and geomorphology, but the topographic evolution of a single landscape from inception to maturity has been difficult to demonstrate in nature. The onlapping dunes of the Cooloola Sand Mass (CSM) in eastern Australia provide an ideal chronosequence to evaluate landscape evolution. Here commonly assumed properties on which landscape models are based (i.e., conservation of mass and major factors contributing to landscape change) can be physically measured and accounted for. Our field based measurements and forward numerical models demonstrate that dunes, like other landscapes, relax in an exponential manner. The emplaced dunes evolve through an initial phase of rapid topographic adjustment associated with the dominance of landsliding. This phase continues for ∼1kyr until hillslope gradients are lowered below their angle of repose (0.65m m−1or 33 degrees. Once sufficiently lowered, the dunes evolve through slow, soil creep processes. These findings of dual transport regimes are validated by stratigraphic records at all excavated dune foot-slopes and we propose that this evolution can be measured by the distribution of curvature (C) of a landform, specifically its standard deviation (σC), as a measure of surface roughness. Surface roughness smooths with time through diffusional sediment transport that lowers local relief. The value and its rate of smoothing can define the stage in evolutionary development and help infer processes, which makes it an important morphometric tool for understanding landscapes. These observations highlight that under stable evolutionary conditions, the development of the landscape is governed by the physical properties of the dune's parent material. In addition, our findings support landscape evolution inferences from numerical and physical models and the coupling of granular material physics with landscape change.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,
Patton:2022roughness,"Here we present a novel application of landscape smoothing with time to generate a detailed chronology of a large and complex dune field. K'gari (Fraser Island) and the Cooloola Sand Mass (CSM) dune fields host thousands of emplaced (relict) and active onlapping parabolic dunes that span 800 000 years in age. While the dune fields have a dating framework, their sheer size (~1930 km2) makes high-resolution dating of the entire system infeasible. Leveraging newly acquired (n = 8) and previously published (n = 20) optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from K'gari and the CSM, we estimate the age of Holocene dunes by building a surface roughness (σC)-age relationship model. In this study, we define σC as the standard deviation of topographic curvature for a dune area and we demonstrate an exponential relationship (r2 = 0.942, RMSE = 0.892 ka) between σC and timing of dune emplacement on the CSM. This relationship is validated using ages from K'gari. We calculate σC utilizing a 5 m digital elevation model and apply our model to predict the ages of 726 individually delineated Holocene dunes. The timing of dune emplacement events is assessed by plotting cumulative probability density functions derived from both measured and predicted dune ages. We demonstrate that both dune fields had four major phases of dune emplacement, peaking at <0.5, ~1.5, ~4, and ~8.5 ka. We observe that our predicted dune ages did not create or remove major events when compared to the OSL-dated sequence, but instead reinforced these patterns. Our study highlights that σC-age modelling can be an easily applied relative or absolute dating tool for dune fields globally. This systematic approach can fill in chronological gaps using only high-resolution elevation data (3-20 m resolution) and a limited set of dune ages.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Patton:2023cooloola,"In this study, we assess charcoal records from eolian deposits within the Cooloola Sand Mass, a subtropical coastal dune system in eastern Australia, to determine whether they can be used as a proxy for Holocene fire history.

Age--depth models are constructed for each profile using radiocarbon measurements (n = 46) and basal optically stimulated luminescence ages (n = 4). All records appear intact with little evidence of postdepositional mixing as demonstrated by minimal age reversals and consistent trends in charcoal concentration and accumulation rates (CHAR) among size classes. Combining all four records, we generate a ca. 7 cal ka BP terrestrial fire history that depicts distinct peaks representing periods of increased local fire activity at <0.3, 1.1--0.4, 2.2--1.6, 3.4--2.6, and 6.7--5.3 cal ka BP. Our findings parallel regional records and highlight the utility of dune footslopes as ecological and sedimentary archives.

Pavey:2016kaluta,"The majority of animals have a specific activity rhythm over the 24 h daily cycle such that they can be categorised as either diurnal or nocturnal. This stability creates interest in understanding species that can invert their activity rhythm. The kaluta, Dasykaluta rosamondae, a small dasyurid marsupial endemic to northern arid Australia, is one such species. In contrast to most other dasyurid species and in fact most small mammals, the kaluta is almost exclusively diurnal in winter. To assess the potential benefits of diurnal activity we examined the diet and assessed potential predators and competitors. We identified 33 food categories including four classes of invertebrates, three classes of vertebrates and plant material. Diet was dominated by Coleoptera (beetles, 26.7% volume) and Formicidae (ants, 25.0% volume). We found no evidence that the prey base of kalutas differed as a consequence of diurnal activity. Likewise, diurnal foraging was probably not driven by competition. A likely explanation of diurnal activity in winter in this species is that it both allows temporal separation in activity from a significant predator, the brush-tailed mulgara, Dasycercus blythi, and reduces thermoregulatory foraging costs.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,

During this time the compoition and characteristics of the flaked stone industries found in this area have altered dramatically. This thesis documents these canges with the aim of examining local strategies for the procurement of lithic raw materials, artefact mnufacture, maintenance, use and discard. The primary focus of analysis is the way in which changes in technology rlate to shifting adaptations, in particular changes in settlement mobility, subsistence activities and patterns of land use. The rainforest sites are all located in an area where high quality raw materials are abundant and widely distributed. Thus it is possible to test the proposition that raw material avaliability and quality was the primary influence on the way that stone technologies were organised. Contrary to some recent suggestions this was not found to be the case and other explanations for changes in the characteristics of these assemblages had to be sought. In Melanesia the change from high mobility to intensive gardening is an obvious point from which to begin to model change in the organisation of flaked stone technologies. The data from this area of the West New Britain rainforest do no tsupport the conventional model of increased sedentism beginning around 3500 years ago. Rather, the stone artefacts assemblages suggest that settlement organisation and subsistence activities changed dramatically at least twice before thi and that increasing sedentism was an aspect of life in the raniforest long before the late Holocene.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

We examined the diet composition and prey preference of this little known dasyurid in the southernmost (Brisbane) and northernmost (Eungella) populations. Animals were captured over three months (July-September) during 2014 encompassing the breeding period (late July and August) of the species. Seasonal sampling carried over into a second year which followed the succeeding cohort of juveniles as they dispersed from their maternal nest (summer), through their maturation (autumn), to the beginning of breeding (winter), sampling across one complete generation. The diet of A. mysticus consisted predominantly of invertebrates, with 16 prey orders identified (11 Insecta, two Arachnida, two Myriapoda, one Crustacea). Vertebrate (Family Scincidae) consumption was recorded in low abundance at both sites. The diet of A. mysticus was dominated by Araneae (spiders), Blattodea (cockroaches) and Coleoptera (beetles). Comparison of identified prey consumption in scats with prey availability in pitfall traps showed A. mysticus to be a dietary generalist, opportunistically consuming mostly invertebrate prey with supplementary predation on small vertebrates. Juvenile A. mysticus preyed predominantly on Blattodea (33.4% mean percentage volume) and Coleoptera (31.6% mean percentage volume), potentially suggesting a preference for larger, easier to catch, prey items.

Peck:2016thesis,"This project focuses on the high-resolution analysis of archaeological marine fauna assemblages, using methodologies situated in an evolutionary ecology theoretical framework. These assemblages come from eight Kaiadilt archaeological sites across the South Wellesley Archipelago, which are a valuable dataset to examine not just dietary composition of foragers in the islands but also long-term patterns in the temporal and spatial availability of subsistence resources. This study also represents the first Australian investigation that applies trophic level analysis to archaeological marine fauna assemblages in order to explore anthropogenic effects on prehistoric fisheries (e.g. Bourque et al. 2008; Reitz et al. 2009; Quitmyer and Reitz 2006). Located in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, in the central north of Australia the study area for this project focuses on Bentinck, Sweers and Fowler Islands, three of the largest islands in the South Wellesley Archipelago and the traditional home of Kaiadilt people. A three phase cultural chronology spanning the past c. 3,500 years is suggested for the study area, based on a comprehensive suite of 128 radiocarbon dates collected from cultural deposits, combined with results from linguistic studies (see Memmott et al. 2016). This archaeological research undertaken in collaboration with the Kaiadilt Aboriginal community has resulted in the recording of cultural places on their lands. Community engagement has been an integral part of this research and ultimately has contributed to the success of the project. At a regional level this thesis contributes to the discourse about Aboriginal subsistence practices in northern Australia for the late Holocene.

Using airborne LiDAR data for 83 small (~ 1 km2) catchments in the western Oregon Coast Range, we quantified variation in model parameters and observed that the curvature of the power-law scaling deviation varies with catchment-averaged erosion rate estimated from cosmogenic nuclides in stream sediments.

Pepin:2013tunas,"The study of the Las Tunas River incisions, located in the eastern Andean foreland front , provides new clues for the interpretation of deep piedmont entrenchments. Both the Las Tunas mountain catchment and its piedmont are strongly entrenched with maximal incision of over 100 m at the mountain front. Three main terrace levels are well exposed and are labelled T1, T2 and T3 from the youngest to the oldest. We combined geological and geomorphological field observations, kinematic GPS data, satellite data and aerial photos with geochronological and analysis to provide a detailed description of terrace organization and a discussion of the evolution of the Las Tunas landscape. The surprisingly constant concentrations in surface layers as deep as 1.5 m show that gently dipping alluvial surfaces can be continuously and deeply mixed. Our data show a first period of deposition (Mesones Fm) before 0.85 Myr (minimum T3 age), followed by deep erosion and a second sedimentation period (Las Tunas Fm) that includes a ca. 0.6 Myr ash deposit. T2 and T1 are inset in the Las Tunas Fm and were abandoned ca. 15–20 kyr ago. The similar ages for T2 and T1 show that post‐20 kyr entrenchment occurred very rapidly. Despite Quaternary deformation in the Las Tunas piedmont, terrace entrenchment is best explained by paleo‐climatic changes. The terrace organization reveals that the erosion‐sedimentation phases affected the entire system from the piedmont toe to 10 km upstream of the mountain front. Finally, contrary to the neighbouring more deeply incised Diamante River system, where late Quaternary piedmont uplift is more likely to have been a factor causing incision, the more stable Las Tunas system provides an incomplete geomorphological record of Pleistocene and Holocene climate variations. We suggest that climate variations are better recorded in uplifting piedmonts than in stable ones, where the magnitude of incision and sedimentation and the fact that they occur repeatedly at the same elevation can erase a large part of the record.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Petchey:2005local,"Marine shell has several advantages for radiocarbon (14C) dating in the Pacific. It is ubiquitous in archaeological sites, is easy to identify to the species level, and can often be related directly to human activity. Consequently, shells are one of the most commonly dated 14C sample types within this region. A suitable local marine correction (∆R) needs to be applied to shell determinations, however, in order to correct for surface ocean 14C variability and obtain calendar ages. This can be achieved using carefully selected charcoal and shell samples recovered from archaeological sites. In this paper, new and extant charcoal and shell 14C determinations from the Kainapirina (SAC) locality on Watom Island in Papua New Guinea have been used to calculate a ∆R of 261 ± 101 14C years.

Petchey:2011testing,"Archaeologists have long debated the origins and mode of dispersal of the immediate predecessors of all Polynesians and many populations in Island Melanesia. Such debates are inextricably linked to a chronological framework provided, in part, by radiocarbon dates. Human remains have the greatest potential for providing answers to many questions pertinent to these debates. Unfortunately, bone is one of the most complicated materials to date reliably because of bone degradation, sample pre-treatment and diet. This is of particular concern in the Pacific where humidity contributes to the rapid decay of bone protein, and a combination of marine, reef, C4, C3 and freshwater foods complicate the interpretation of 14C determinations. Independent advances in bone pre-treatment, isotope multivariate modelling and radiocarbon calibration techniques provide us, for the first time, with the tools to obtain reliable calibrated ages for Pacific burials. Here we present research that combines these techniques, enabling us to re-evaluate the age of burials from key archaeological sites in the Pacific.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Petchey:2012bismarck,"Interactions between islands, ocean currents, and winds cause large-scale eddies and upwelling in the lee of islands that can result in spatial variation in the marine radiocarbon reservoir. For waters around New Ireland and the Bismarck Sea, ΔR values ranging from 365 to −320 14C yr have been reported (Kirch 2001; Petchey et al. 2004). Petchey et al. (2004) proposed that some of this variation was caused by seasonal reversals in the South Equatorial Current and North Equatorial Counter Current system, combined with Ekman upwelling from the Equator. McGregor et al. (2008) suggested additional complexity within this region caused by a change in the reservoir value over time in response to changing climatic conditions. We present a series of 14 new and extant published ΔR and R values on historic shells, combined with 8 values from archaeological terrestrial/marine pairs and U-Th dated coral, that support observations of localized variability caused by a complex interplay between seasonal currents, riverine input, and ocean eddies. On the basis of these values and oceanographic data, we divide the Bismarck Sea surface marine 14C reservoir into 6 tentative subregions. In particular, our results support significant variation within channels at the southwest and southeast ends of New Britain and towards the equatorial boundary of the sea. Our results indicate that within the Bismarck Sea geographical variation appears to be more extreme than temporal over the last 3000 yr.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Petchey:2012marine,"Herbivorous and deposit-feeding gastropods are a major component of archaeological shell middens worldwide. They provide a wealth of information about subsistence, economy, environment, and climate, but are generally considered to be less than ideal for radiocarbon dating because they can ingest sediment while they graze, inadvertently consuming terrestrial carbon in the process. However, few studies of 14C activity in herbivores or deposit-feeding gastropods have been conducted into this diverse range of animals that inhabit many environmental niches. Here, we present results investigating 14C variability in shells belonging to the families Strombidae and Potamididae from the Bogi 1 archaeological site, Caution Bay, southern coastal Papua New Guinea (PNG). These shells make up 39.3% of the shell MNI in the excavation units studied and some of these species are the most common taxa of neighboring sites. It would therefore be advantageous to establish if there are any 14C offsets associated with such animals, and identify those that can give reliable calendar ages. Our methodology combines a high-resolution excavation protocol, selection of short-lived samples identified to species level, and a triisotope approach using 14C, δ13C, and δ18O to evaluate the source of variability in shells. Our results indicate that considerable variation exists between different species of Strombidae with some inhabiting muddier environments that act as sinks for limestone-derived sediments with depleted 14C content. The magnitude of variation is, however, overshadowed by that measured in the mudwhelk, Cerithidea largillierti, which has the largest spread in 14C of any shellfish studied so far at Caution Bay. This animal ingests sediment within the estuary that contains 14C derived from both enriched and depleted sources.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Petchey:2013dating,"The remains of shellfish dominate many coastal archaeological sites in the Pacific and provide a wealth of information about economy, culture, environment and climate. Shells are therefore the logical sample type to develop local and regional radiocarbon chronologies. The calibration of radiocarbon (14C) dates on marine animals is not straightforward, however, requiring an understanding of habitat and dietary preferences as well as detailed knowledge of local ocean conditions. The most complex situations occur where terrestrial influences impinge on the marine environment resulting in both the enrichment and depletion of 14C (Ulm Geoarchaeology 17(4):319–348, 2002; Petchey and Clark Quat Geochronol 6:539–549, 2011). A sampling protocol that combines a high-resolution excavation methodology, selection of short-lived samples identified to species level, and a triisotope approach using 14C, δ13C and δ18O, has given us the ability to identify 14C source variation that would otherwise have been obscured. Here, we present new research that details high-resolution mapping of marine 14C reservoir variation between Gafrarium tumidum, Gafrarium pectinatum, Anadara granosa, Anadara antiquata, Batissa violacea, Polymesoda erosa and Echinoidea from the Bogi 1 archaeological site, Caution Bay, southern coastal Papua New Guinea.

Pfeifer:2021growing,"Many mountain ranges survive in a phase of erosional decay for millions of years (Myr) following the cessation of tectonic activity. Landscape dynamics in these post-orogenic settings have long puzzled geologists due to the expectation that topographic relief should decline with time. Our understanding of how denudation rates, crustal dynamics, bedrock erodibility, climate, and mantle-driven processes interact to dictate the persistence of relief in the absence of ongoing tectonics is incomplete. Here we explore how lateral variations in rock type, ranging from resistant quartzites to less-resistant schists and phyllites and up to the least-resistant gneisses and granitic rocks, have affected rates and patterns of denudation and topographic forms in a humid semitropical, high-relief, post-orogenic landscape in Brazil where active tectonics ended hundreds of Myr ago. We show that denudation rates are negatively correlated to topographic relief, channel steepness and modern precipitation rates. Denudation instead correlates with inferred bedrock strength, with resistant rocks denuding more slowly relative to more erodible rock units, and suggest that the efficiency of fluvial erosion varies primarily due to these bedrock differences. Variations in erodibility continue to drive contrasts in rates of denudation in a tectonically inactive landscape evolving for hundreds of Myr, suggesting that equilibrium is not a natural attractor state and that relief continues to grow through time. Over the long timescales of post-orogenic development, exposure at the surface of rock types with differential erodibility can become a dominant control on landscape dynamics by producing spatial variations in geomorphic processes and rates, promoting the survival of relief, and determining spatial differences in erosional response timescales long after cessation of mountain building.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Pietsch:2006gwydir,"This study examines the downstream changes in the character of the Gwydir distributary system which flows across the Gwydir fan-plain, a large (~ 7500 km2) low gradient alluvial surface which forms part of the Darling Riverine Plains of southeastern Australia. The Late Quaternary history of the distributary system is evaluated by investigating the chronology and probable discharges of palaeochannels at or near the surface of the fan-plain. Channels of the contemporary distributary system are characterized by downstream declining discharges, in part a result of the interaction of the modern system with remnants of the preceding palaeochannel systems. The hydraulic geometry of the contemporary channels revealed that these distributaries do not have a uniform response to declining discharge, with differences in heights of off-takes leading to differences in sedimentology, hydrology and channel morphology. Of the four distributaries, the Gwydir River is the bedload transporting trunk stream, hence its hydraulic geometry is fundamentally influenced by the need to maintain bedload conveyance as discharge declines downstream. It maintains a relatively deep channel facilitated in part by adoption of an anabranching habit in its lower reaches, and by relatively continuous flow that keeps its bed free of vegetation. Hence it has a relatively low W/​D ratio. ... [_truncated_]",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2023-01-11 09:27:56.169 +0100
Pietsch:2013gwydir,"Ages for large palaeochannels of the Gwydir distributive fluvial system (DFS) in northern New South Wales, Australia have been determined using single grain optically stimulated luminescence. Two palaeochannel systems have been found to dominate; the here named Coocalla (43-34~ka) and Kamilaroi (19-16~ka) which have inferred palaeodischarges 25-100 times the bankfull discharges of nearby channels of the contemporary Gwydir system, which appears to have been established during the Mid-Holocene. This scale differential is very much larger than that reported for other catchments in southeastern Australia, and reflects both a decline in catchment runoff through the Last Glacial cycle and the adoption of a distributary pattern sometime after 16~ka. Actual decline in catchment runoff, determined by comparing estimated palaeodischarge with contemporary flows upstream of the DFS where flow is confined to a single channel, indicate contemporary discharge to be 0.1 times and 0.25 times that of the Coocalla and Kamilaroi, respectively. The chronology presented here shows periods of increased discharge in the Gwydir to be more or less coincident with those observed elsewhere in the Murray Darling Basin. Although no evidence of a 'Gum Creek' fluvial phase (from 35 to 25~ka) was found, the Coocalla and Kamilaroi palaeochannel systems broadly conform in age to 'Kerarbury' and 'Yanco' fluvial phases on the Murrumbidgee and Murray systems. This synchronicity with more southern catchments supports the hypothesis that La Nina - like conditions were semi-permanent for much of the Last Glacial cycle with moisture derived largely from the western Pacific Ocean.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Pietsch:2015normanby,"We present the results of investigations into alluvial deposition in the catchment of the Normanby River, which flows into Princess Charlotte Bay (PCB) in the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon. Our focus is on the fine fraction (<~63µm) of alluvial deposits that sit above the sand and gravel bars of the channel floor, but below the expansive flat surface generally referred to as the floodplain. Variously described as benches, bank attached bars or inset or inner floodplains, these more or less flat-lying surfaces within the macro-channel have hitherto received little attention in sediment budgeting models. We use high resolution LiDAR based mapping combined with optical dating of exposures cut into these in-channel deposits to compare their aggradation rates with those found in other depositional zones in the catchment, namely the floodplain and coastal plain. In total 59 single grain OSL dates were produced across 21 stratigraphic profiles at 14 sites distributed though the 24226km2 catchment. In-channel storage in these inset features is a significant component of the contemporary fine sediment budget (i.e. recent decades/last century), annually equivalent to more than 50% of the volume entering the channel network from hillslopes and subsoil sources. Therefore, at the very least, in-channel storage of fine material needs to be incorporated into sediment budgeting exercises. Furthermore, deposition within the channel has occurred in multiple locations coincident in time with accelerated sediment production following European settlement. Generally, this has occurred on a subset of the features we have examined here, namely linear bench features low in the channel. This suggests that accelerated aggradation on in-channel depositional surfaces has been in part a response to accelerated erosion within the catchment. The entire contribution of ~370 kilotonnes per annum of fine sediment estimated to have been produced by alluvial gully erosion over the last ~100years can be accounted for by that stored as in-channel alluvium. These features therefore can play an important role in mitigating the impact on the receiving water of accelerated erosion.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Multiple lines of evidence show that the Atacama has been hyperarid since at least the late Miocene, among these are cosmic-ray exposure ages indicating that individual clasts on some surfaces have been preserved for > 9 Ma and possibly since the Oligocene. Although these remarkably old ages indicate slow landscape evolution, it is not clear whether this pace is characteristic of the entire Atacama, or only of specific regions, landforms, or landscape elements. To address this question, we measured cosmogenic 10Be, 26Al, and 21Ne from a wide variety of landscape elements in a transect across the Central Atacama, where modern precipitation is at an extreme minimum, but where the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides in stable landscape elements has not previously been recorded. We find that the hyperarid core of the Central Atacama has substantially slower erosion rates than its eastern and western margins; however, even the driest part of this transect has erosion rates comparable to those of other deserts, ranging from 0.2–0.4 m/Ma. The most stable landscape elements are boulder fields, with exposure ages of 1.5–2.6 Ma. The vast majority of samples in the Central Atacama Desert, however, have cosmogenic nuclide concentrations corresponding to ages < 1.2 Ma, indicative of Pleistocene modification of almost the entire landscape. Furthermore, extreme boulder ages > 5 Ma documented elsewhere in the Atacama were not found in our area and appear to be limited to exceptionally stable boulders or cobbles in either the northern or southern extremes of the Atacama Desert.

Portenga:2015bhutanese,"Western Bhutan provides an ideal setting to understand the interplay between uplift, erosion, and fluvial sediment transport in an active mountain environment. Using in situ-produced 10Be (49 samples) and 26Al (5 samples) in fluvial sediment from nested catchments throughout the Puna Tsang Chhu drainage basin, we examine erosion rates in different geomorphic environments including two high-relief regions – a glacierized zone in the north and a high-rainfall zone in the south – as well as remnants of an uplifted, lower-relief paleosurface between them. The erosion rates roughly mirror this north–south zonation: lower rates (avg. 388 ± 32 m My− 1, n = 16) prevail in the low-relief zone, roughly coinciding with lower-relief terrain where mean annual precipitation is ~ 1500 mm yr− 1; the highest rates (avg. 956 ± 160 m My− 1, n = 13) are in the south (27.10°–27.35°N), where rainfall is > 4000 mm yr− 1; high rates (avg. 700 ± 62 m My− 1, n = 15) also occur in the northern, glacierized region (27.70°–28.10°N). All 49 purified mineral separates used in this study contain measurable amounts of native 9Be (up to 900 μg), violating the assumption of negligible 9Be that is commonly made in the isotope dilution method used to quantify 10Be. To correct for this native 9Be, we use high precision, replicate measurements of 9Be in each sample to calculate 10Be concentrations from measured isotopic ratios. Neglecting native 9Be would have led to erosion rate overestimates from <20\% to >400\%. The pervasive nature of 9Be in these samples underscores the importance of quantifying the native 9Be concentration in mineral separates used for cosmogenic 10Be analysis.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Portenga:2016burning,"The extent to which Aboriginal Australians used fire to modify their environment has been debated for decades and is generally based on charcoal and pollen records rather than landscape responses to land-use change. Here we investigate the sensitivity of in-situ-produced 10Be, an isotope commonly used in geomorphological contexts, to anthropogenic perturbations in the southeastern Australian Tablelands. Comparing 10Be-derived erosion rates from fluvial sediment (8.7 ± 0.9 mm k.y.-1; 1 standard error, SE; n = 11) and rock outcrops (5.3 ± 1.4 mm k.y.-1; 1 SE; n = 6) confirms that landscape lowering rates integrating over 104-105 yr are consistent with rates previously derived from studies integrating over 104 to >107 yr. We then model an expected 10Be inventory in fluvial sediment if background erosion rates were perturbed by a low-intensity, high-frequency Aboriginal burning regime. When we run the model using the average erosion rate derived from 10Be in fluvial sediment (8.7 mm k.y.-1), measured and modeled 10Be concentrations overlap between ca. 3 ka and 1 ka. Our modeling is consistent with intensified Aboriginal use of fire in the late Holocene, a time when Aboriginal population growth is widely recognized.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Portenga:2016goulburn,"The timing of landscape change, post-settlement alluvium (PSA) deposition and gully erosion in the southeastern Australian Tablelands remains at the centre of a long-standing discussion over the geomorphological effects of European land-use compared with Aboriginal land-use and climate change. Few quantitative studies date the onset of gully erosion and subsequent PSA deposition in the Tablelands and those that do determine the timing of landscape change for individual catchments rather than across the region. In this study, we present optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) burial ages of swampy meadow (SM) sediment and PSA from six sites spread throughout the Goulburn Plains to place better regional constraints on the timing of landscape change. PSA burial ages at each of our sample sites range between 213 and 81 years before AD 2013, the year during which all samples were collected and measured – corresponding to AD 1800–1932. All measured PSA burial ages post-date European arrival to Australia and are therefore consistent with the generic name and implied age assigned to these sediments before quantitative age estimates were available for them. We suggest, however, that the term post-European settlement alluvium may be more appropriate in the Australian context as Aboriginal Australians were living in the Tablelands prior to European arrival. Associations between the occurrence of gully incision and PSA deposition throughout the Tablelands and climatic factors are tenuous, and we suggest that European land-use practices in the region dominate landscape evolution, which had been driven by climatic factors throughout the Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The European situation has been used as a theoretical basis for correlation of climatic changes on a world wide scale, while the available evidence, especially from British diagrams, of human influences more often than not overriding those of climate, has hardly been considered. The present study was undertaken to fill a gap in this knowledge and to try to show that the palynological method could provide objective evidence of human influence on vegetation in a tropical region, readily distinguishable from climatic influences. The investigation involved stratigraphic and palynological studies of lake and swamp sites in a highland region o:f New Guinea together with a local survey of present day vegetation and modern pollen rain.

Prebble:2005vanderlin,"Sedimentary, palynological and diatom data from a dunefield lake deposit in the interior of Vanderlin Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria are presented. Prior to the formation of present perennial lake conditions, the intensified Australian monsoon associated with the early Holocene marine transgression allowed Cyperaceae sedges to colonise the alluvial margins of an expansive salt flat surrounded by an open Eucalyptus woodland. As sea level stabilised between 7500 and 4500 cal yr B.P. coastal dunes ceased to develop allowing dense Melaleuca forest to establish in a Restionaceae swamp. Dune-sand input into the swamp was diminished further as the increasingly dense vegetation prevented fluvial and aeolian transported sand arriving from coastal sources. This same process impounded the drainage basin allowing a perennial lake to form between 5500 and 4000 cal yr B.P. Myriophyllum and other aquatic taxa colonised the lake periphery under the most extensive woodland recorded for the Holocene. The palynological data support an effective precipitation model proposed for northern Australia that suggests more variable conditions in the late Holocene. A more precise measure of effective precipitation change is provided by diatom-based inferences that indicate few changes in lake hydrology. Such interpretations are explained in terms of palynological sensitivity to adjustments in local fire regimes where regional precipitation change may only be recorded indirectly through fire promoting mechanisms, including intensified ENSO periodicity and human impact.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

Prentice:2005snowline,"Geomorphological mapping and lake-core data from Mt. Jaya, western New Guinea, show that Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciation was less extensive than previously thought. Average equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs), calculated using the area–altitude-balance ratio method, for minimum and maximum ice configurations were 4050±49 and 4000±56 m a.s.l., respectively. This is about 600 m below the ELA of the Mt. Jaya glaciers in 1971–73 and ca 400 m higher than values previously quoted for LGM ELAs in this area. A reappraisal of the evidence used to reconstruct the ELA of glaciers across New Guinea suggests that published chronologies are not sufficient to demonstrate that reported ELAs fall within the LGM window of 21,000±2 yr BP. Furthermore, the published information only constrains the altitude of the ELAs between 3400 and 3800 m a.s.l., not including uncertainty in topography. A simple mass and energy-balance model indicates that an ELA depression of 500 m (i.e., the observed change at Mt.

Isoodon obesulus, Perameles bougainville and P. nasuta are reported for the first time in the Darling Downs fossil record. Accelerator mass spectrometry 14C dates based on charcoal from bandicoot fossil-bearing stratigraphic horizons indicates deposition 45-40 ka. Additional material attributed to the recently described Darling Downs P. sobbei is also described. P. sobbei retains plesiomorphic characters in the upper dentition including reduction of the metaconule on M3 and the lack of posterior cingula on M2 and M3. Phylogenetic interpretation of dental characters suggests that P. sobbei has closer affinities to the Pliocene P. bowensis than to any modern species. The presence of extant species such as P. bougainville and I. obesulus as fossils provides evidence that scrublands and closed woodlands with dense understories existed on the Darling Downs during the Pleistocene. The Darling Downs bandicoot assemblage represents the only known fauna, fossil or modern, where I. obesulus, P. bougainville and P. nasuta occur sympatrically. The Pleistocene Darling Downs may have had a more equable climate than occurs today and a greater range of habitat niches to support such populations. The southern and western contraction of the geographical ranges of I. obesulus and P. bougainville between the Pleistocene and the present was probably the result of significant environmental change that may have involved the contraction of woodlands and expansion of grasslands. The persistence of P. nasuta populations on the Darling Downs from the Pleistocene to the present may reflect that species' ability to adapt to a wide range of habitats.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Price:2006darling,"The Kings Creek catchment, southeastern Queensland, contains a variety of Pleistocene~-~Holocene depositional settings. Fluvial depositional accumulation processes in the catchment reflect both high-energy channel and low-energy episodic overbank deposition. The lithofacies and depositional environments of locality QML796 were examined in detail to aid interpretation of taphonomic accumulation patterns of large and small taxa in the deposit. The basal fossiliferous unit was deposited in a meandering channel and passes upward into overbank deposits that include ephemeral interfluve channels and splays. The most striking taphonomic observations on vertebrates at the locality include: (i) low representation of post-cranial elements; (ii) high degree of bone breakage; (iii) variable abrasion with most identifiable bone elements having a low to moderate degree of abrasion; (iv) low rates of bone weathering; (v) a low degree of carnivore bone modification; and (vi) a low degree of articulated or associated specimens. Collectively, these data suggest that the material was transported into the deposit from the surrounding proximal floodplain and that the assemblages reflect substantial hydraulic sorting. However, despite that, sequential faunal horizons show a stepwise decrease in taxonomic diversity that cannot be explained by sampling or taphonomic bias. The decreasing diversity includes loss of some, but not all, megafauna and is consistent with a progressive local loss of megafauna in the catchment over an extended interval of time.

We provide the first unambiguous evidence of koalas in the Pliocene Chinchilla Local Fauna (phascolarctid indet. and Ph. ?stirtoni): important additions to an increasingly diverse arboreal mammalian assemblage that also includes tree kangaroos. The persistence of koalas and local extinction of tree kangaroos in the Chinchilla region today suggests that significant habitat and faunal reorganization occurred between the Pliocene and Recent, presumably reflecting the expansion of open woodlands and grasslands. Other koala records from the newly U/Th-dated Middle Pleistocene Marmor and Mt. Etna fossil deposits (Phascolarctos sp. and Ph. ?stirtoni), along with independent palaeohabitat proxies, indicate the former presence of heterogeneous habitats comprised of rainforests, open woodlands and grasslands.

Price:2009megafauna,"Arguments over the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna have become particularly polarised in recent years. Causes for the extinctions are widely debated with climate change, human hunting and/or habitat modification, or a combination of those factors, being the dominant hypotheses. However, a lack of a spatially constrained chronology for many megafauna renders most hypotheses difficult to test. Here, we present several new U/Th dates for a series of previously undated, megafauna-bearing localities from southeastern Queensland, Australia. The sites were previously used to argue for or against various megafauna extinction hypotheses, and are the type localities for two now-extinct Pleistocene marsupials (including the giant koala, Phascolarctos stirtoni). The new dating allows the deposits to be placed in a spatially- and temporally constrained context relevant to the understanding of Australian megafaunal extinctions. The results indicate that The Joint (Texas Caves) megafaunal assemblage is middle Pleistocene or older (>292ky); the Cement Mills (Gore) megafaunal assemblage is late Pleistocene or older (>53ky); and the Russenden Cave Bone Chamber (Texas Caves) megafaunal assemblage is late Pleistocene (∼55ky). Importantly, the new results broadly show that the sites date prior to the hypothesised megafaunal extinction window (i.e., ∼30–50ky), and therefore, cannot be used to argue exclusively for or against human/climate change extinction models, without first exploring their palaeoecological significance on wider temporal and spatial scales.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Price:2011darling,"A key to understanding Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction dynamics is knowledge of megafaunal ecological response(s) to long-term environmental perturbations. Strategically, that requires targeting fossil deposits that accumulated during glacial and interglacial intervals both before and after human arrival, with subsequent palaeoecological models underpinned by robust and reliable chronologies. Late Pleistocene vertebrate fossil localities from the Darling Downs, eastern Australia, provide stratigraphically-intact, abundant megafaunal sequences, which allows for testing of anthropogenic versus climate change megafauna extinction hypotheses. Each stratigraphic unit at site QML796, Kings Creek Catchment, was previously shown to have had similar sampling potential, and the basal units contain both small-sized taxa (e.g., land snails, frogs, bandicoots, rodents) and megafauna. Importantly, sequential faunal horizons show stepwise decrease in taxonomic diversity with the loss of some, but not all, megafauna in the geographically-small palaeocatchment. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of our intensive, multidisciplinary dating study of the deposits (>40 dates). Dating by means of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C (targeting bone, freshwater molluscs, and charcoal) and thermal ionisation mass spectrometry U/Th (targeting teeth and freshwater molluscs) do not agree with each other and, in the case of AMS 14C dating, lack internal consistency. Scanning electron microscopy and rare earth element analyses demonstrate that the dated molluscs are diagenetically altered and contain aragonite cements that incorporated secondary young C, suggesting that such dates should be regarded as minimum ages. AMS 14C dated charcoals provide ages that occur out of stratigraphic order, and cluster in the upper chronological limits of the technique (∼40–48 ka). Again, we suggest that such results should be regarded as suspicious and only minimum ages. Subsequent OSL and U/Th (teeth) dating provide complimentary results and demonstrate that the faunal sequences actually span ∼120–83 ka, thus occurring beyond the AMS 14C dating window. Importantly, the dates suggest that the local decline in biological diversity was initiated ∼75,000 years before the colonisation of humans on the continent. Collectively, the data are most parsimoniously consistent with a pre-human climate change model for local habitat change and megafauna extinction, but not with a nearly simultaneous extinction of megafauna as required by the human-induced blitzkrieg extinction hypothesis. This study demonstrates the problems inherent in dating deposits that lie near the chronological limits of the radiocarbon dating technique, and highlights the need to cross-check previously-dated archaeological and megafauna deposits within the timeframe of earliest human colonisation and latest megafaunal survival.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Price:2013dating,"Although vertebrate fossils are commonly abundant in museum palaeontological collections, they are only rarely accompanied by contextual data (e.g., stratigraphic and taphonomic information) that allow~them to be placed independently into reliable temporal frameworks critical for testing significant evolutionary and extinction hypotheses. Moreover, where critical samples do exist in such collections, sampling for direct geochronological analyses becomes a significant concern, especially where such~sampling is destructive in nature. Here we apply a direct fossil dating, micro-drilling sampling approach that minimises damage to and destruction of precious museum specimens. We carried out a systematic U-Th dating study (n~=~28 ages) of an isolated museum specimen of the extinct Palorchestes azael (megafaunal 'marsupial tapir') originally collected in 1977 from Tea Tree Cave, Chillagoe, northeastern Australia. We obtained 21 U-Th ages and constructed 230Th-age profiles across three teeth exposed in cross-section, using micro-drilling and thermal ionisation mass spectrometry. Individual sample masses were as little as 0.18~mg (U concentration 33-82~ppm), meaning that the sampling resulted in only minimal destruction of the specimen. The results show no evidence of U leaching, suggesting that the dates represent reliable minimum ages. For independent age control, we also dated calcite that had encrusted the sample (thus, providing a minimum age; n~=~6) and an older calcite clast that had been~reworked into the surrounding breccia at the time of burial (thus, providing a maximum age; n~=~1). U-Th ages of the teeth are older than the calcite overgrowths and younger than the reworked calcite, consistent with their demonstrable relative age relationships. Collectively, the results unequivocally bracket the age of the fossil between 199.1~±~8.9~ka and 137.4~±~1.1~ka (2 sigma), adding another rare datum to inform the timing and geographic distribution of last occurrences of the species. The benefits of our dating approach of museum fossil specimens are threefold: 1) it is minimally destructive even compared with laser-ablation method; 2) the use of U vs. apparent age approach allows direct testing for potential U leaching as occasionally seen in fossil dating; and 3) the combination of fossil and associated speleothem dating provides the most robust means of securely bracketing the age of fossils that lack firm stratigraphic control.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Price:2015overlap,"An obvious but key prerequisite to testing hypotheses concerning the role of humans in the extinction of late Quaternary 'megafauna' is demonstrating that humans and the extinct taxa overlapped, both temporally and spatially. In many regions, a paucity of reliably dated fossil occurrences of megafauna makes it challenging, if not impossible, to test many of the leading extinction hypotheses. The giant monitor lizards of Australia are a case in point. Despite commonly being argued to have suffered extinction at the hands of the first human colonisers (who arrived by 50~ka), it has never been reliably demonstrated that giant monitors and humans temporally overlapped in Australia. Here we present the results of an integrated U-Th and 14C dating study of a late Pleistocene fossil deposit that has yielded the youngest dated remains of giant monitor lizards in Australia. The site, Colosseum Chamber, is a cave deposit in the Mt Etna region, central eastern Australia. Sixteen new dates were generated and demonstrate that the bulk of the material in the deposit accumulated since ca. 50~ka. The new monitor fossil is, minimally, 30~ky younger than the previous youngest reliably dated record for giant lizards in Australia and for the first time, demonstrates that on a continental scale, humans and giant lizards overlapped in time. The new record brings the existing geochronological dataset for Australian giant monitor lizards to seven dated occurrences. With such sparse data, we are hesitant to argue that our new date represents the time of their extinction from the continent. Rather, we suspect that future fossil collecting will yield new samples both older and younger than 50~ka. Nevertheless, we unequivocally demonstrate that humans and giant monitor lizards overlapped temporally in Australia, and thus, humans can only now be considered potential drivers for their extinction.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Borugaboodie may represent the least derived member of a lineage containing Caloprymnus, Milliyowi and Aepyprymnus. The dentary of B. hatcheri seems to have been capable of generating proportionally larger bite forces than modern bettongs, suggesting a more resistant diet.

Despite the remarkable diversity of animals and plants, including eight previously unknown kangaroo species, two of them tree kangaroos, the climate was similar to that of today.

While 90% of Australia's large mammals were extinct by ca. 45 ka, their responses to glacial-interglacial cycling have remained unknown, due to a lack of rigorous biostratigraphic studies and the rarity of terrestrial climatic records that can be related directly to faunal records. We present an analysis of faunal data from the Naracoorte Caves in southeastern Australia, which are unique not only because of the species richness and time-depth of the assemblages that they contain, but also because this faunal record is directly comparable with a 500 k.y. speleothem-based record of local effective moisture. Our data reveal that, despite significant population fluctuations driven by glacial-interglacial cycling, the species composition of the mammal fauna was essentially stable for 500 k.y. before the late Pleistocene extinctions. Larger species declined during a drier interval between 270 and 220 ka, likely reflecting range contractions away from Naracoorte, but they then recovered locally, persisting well into the late Pleistocene. Because the speleothem record and prior faunal response imply that local conditions should have been favorable for megafauna until at least 30 ka, climate change is unlikely to have been the principal cause of the extinctions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Prideaux:2010extinctions,"Explaining the Late Pleistocene demise of many of the world's larger terrestrial vertebrates is arguably the most enduring and debated topic in Quaternary science. Australia lost >90% of its larger species by around 40 thousand years (ka) ago, but the relative importance of human impacts and increased aridity remains unclear. Resolving the debate has been hampered by a lack of sites spanning the last glacial cycle. Here we report on an exceptional faunal succession from Tight Entrance Cave, southwestern Australia, which shows persistence of a diverse mammal community for at least 100 ka leading up to the earliest regional evidence of humans at 49 ka. Within 10 millennia, all larger mammals except the gray kangaroo and thylacine are lost from the regional record. Stable-isotope, charcoal, and small-mammal records reveal evidence of environmental change from 70 ka, but the extinctions occurred well in advance of the most extreme climatic phase. We conclude that the arrival of humans was probably decisive in the southwestern Australian extinctions, but that changes in climate and fire activity may have played facilitating roles. One-factor explanations for the Pleistocene extinctions in Australia are likely oversimplistic.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Prideaux:2022reevaluating,"The causes of the Late Pleistocene extinction of most larger-bodied animals on the Australian continent have long been controversial. This is due, in no small part, to inadequate knowledge of exactly when these species were lost from different ecosystems. The Nombe rockshelter in the highlands of Papua New Guinea is one of very few sites on Sahul with as-yet-unrefuted evidence for the survival of megafaunal species until more recently than 40 thousand years (ka) ago. However, our understanding of the age of this site has been based on radiocarbon dating. Here we present new U--Th ages on large marsupial specimens from the deposit and identify a range of postcranial elements to species that include the diprotodontid Hulitherium tomasettii, kangaroo Protemnodon tumbuna and thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus. Direct U--Th ages of 27--22 ka ago on faunal remains of Protemnodon tumbuna and another large unidentified macropodid are consistent with the existing radiocarbon chronology, yet are minimum ages due to the potential for post-depositional uptake of 238U and stratigraphic reworking. Pollen analyses indicate perhumid, montane forests dominated by Nothofagus persisted, with minimal human disturbance from at least c.26--20 ka ago up to the terminal Pleistocene. Collagen fingerprinting (ZooMS) demonstrates the potential of protein-based identification of megafaunal remains at Nombe in the future. This study leaves open the possibility of extended coexistence between some megafaunal species in the montane rainforests of New Guinea and intermittently visiting groups of people, and underscores the need for further investigation of the Nombe deposit. Although preliminary, these findings reinforce the view that debates regarding megafaunal extinctions on Sahul require a greater appreciation of species-specific temporalities and the degrees of human impact on diverse habitats across the continent.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Pritchard:2019burley,"The incidence of allergy-related respiratory ailments in Australia is ranked amongst some of the highest in the world. Of interest is how European settlement and the introduction of numerous wind pollinated species from the Northern Hemisphere may have increased the impact on public health.

Canberra, however, is a planned city, with the bulk of its expansion and construction occurring since the latter part of the 20th century. The well-documented development of Canberra provides a unique opportunity to assess the evolution of the allergenic environment in this region through the lens of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Sediments collected from Lake Burley Griffin were processed for their pollen content to assess how the allergenic load has changed since the founding of Canberra. The analysis reflected historical records of changing land uses and revealed an increasingly allergenic airborne pollen load over the past 90 years, coinciding with population increase and urban development, and underpinned by Canberra's tree planting scheme. In addition, fire was examined in the record, with the charcoal fractions revealing a complex fire history.

Proske:2012island,"Vegetation changes of tropical Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, Australia) over the last 8000 years are derived from palaeoenvironmental analysis of a 475 cm long sediment core. During early-Holocene sea-level rise, flooding of the continental shelf and thus isolation of Lizard Island, the pollen record shows the gradual establishment of a mangrove forest paralleled by contraction of the near-coastal palm and grass-dominated vegetation. Subsequently, mid-Holocene relative environmental stability supported a diverse, Rhizophora-dominated mangrove and open, mixed sclerophyll vegetation inland. Around 6000 years ago, a profound disturbance of the mangrove is recorded by a siliciclastic layer and we hypothesise that this deposit documents the impact of a storm or cyclone. Postevent environmental conditions were strongly altered with enhanced estuarine conditions supporting a Sonneratia and Bruguiera-dominated mangrove forest. During late-Holocene sea-level fall and stabilisation, progradation and contraction of the mangrove forest was paralleled by the expansion of a palm-dominated swamp. Freshwater taxa continued to dominate the record, however, a distinct disturbance signal from anthropogenic activity is recorded in the last century. Although Sonneratia dominated the post-event mangrove, late-Holocene environmental instability led to the extinction of this genus on the island. Local environmental changes in the freshwater swamp and rainforest also led to the loss of Arenga and Ilex from the island’s ecosystems. Our record implies that long-term ecosystem and biodiversity change on Lizard Island is: (a) primarily reflected in the spatial extent of the island’s vegetation communities and the species dominance within them and (b) driven by an interplay between climate, sea-level and potentially human activity. In addition, a short-term impact provoked the reconfiguration of the mangrove, potentially causing long-term ecosystem instability and thus impacting on mangrove biodiversity development on the Great Barrier Reef islands.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,
Proske:2014kimberley,"A 6-m-long sediment core from the King River region of north-west Australia has been analysed using sedimentological and palynological techniques. The core spans most parts of the Holocene and contains a detailed record of early to mid-Holocene landscape development. In the early Holocene an intertidal environment supported a diverse and probably extensive mangrove forest. Intensified fluvial activity, high mangrove biodiversity and the proximity of freshwater swamp vegetation reflect enhanced summer monsoon rainfall. From 7.4k cal a BP onwards, the mangrove forest starts to contract reaching minimum (and probably present-day) extent by 6.5k cal a BP. Late Holocene aridification led to shifts in mangrove composition, the expansion of hypersaline flats and the transition of freshwater swamps to intermittent wetlands. In addition, fire potentially played an increasing role in controlling ecosystem composition, in particular in the savanna/woodland vegetation. This record is the first of its kind from coastal north-west Australia and demonstrates that sea-level and climatic fluctuations, in addition to local geomorphological settings, are major controllers of landscape development.

Proske:2016wetland,"In 1990, the freshwater wetlands and mangroves near Wyndham, north-west Australia, were Ramsar-listed due to their ecological importance. To understand wetland formation and stability over time, two sediment cores from the King River and one from the Parry Lagoons wetlands were analysed using sedimentological and palynological techniques. During postglacial sea-level rise, mangroves extended across all sites and were supported by enhanced freshwater input. Between 7.4 and 6.3k cal a BP the mangrove forest contracted, probably driven by sea-level stabilization, and hypersaline mudflats, reflecting the onset of drier climatic conditions, developed along the King River. After 6.3k cal a BP mangrove diversity declined, probably linked to peak dryness around 4k cal a BP. The Parry Lagoons wetlands are at least approx. 600 years old and their development is probably related to an increase in effective precipitation since approx. 1k cal a BP. The region's mangroves could be considered relatively stable under changing climate as they are still present today, although reduced in biodiversity and areal extent. The early phases of development of the Parry Lagoons freshwater systems cannot be resolved but given the character of these wetlands, freshwater input appears to be the vital driver of ecosystem functioning.",2023-07-22 06:51:38.269 +0200,

The results of monitoring show that before and after mild fires there is insufficient runoff on most slopes to entrain sediment.

Przywolnik:2002patterns,"This thesis presents the results of archaeological research at the northern tip of Cape Range peninsula in the northwest of Western Australia. This research has revealed evidence of a dynamic and varied archaeological use of the region spanning 36,000 years. The occupational history of Cape Range is characterised by flexibility and adaptability, and comprises three main phases interspersed with periods of abandonment. Excavations in three stratified limestone rockshelter sites demonstrate significant long-term changes in patterns of Aboriginal occupation of the study area. Two of the sites provide evidence of late Pleistocene use, and share broad similarities in periods of occupational hiatus spanning the late glacial maximum. Reoccupation of the rockshelter sites is associated with evidence of the extensive exploitation of mangrove environments following post-glacial climatic amelioration. Increases in the amounts of ochres at this time in C99, along with evidence of a relative chronology for rock art in this area, are interpreted as signalling the first phase of rock art activity during the early Holocene. A second period of abandonment occurred during the mid Holocene, coinciding with the decline of mangrove environments in the area. The third occupational phase during the late Holocene, from c2500 BP, is characterised by the introduction of new stone tool types, changes in raw material use, intensive exploitation of turtle, processing of desert walnuts in roasting pits and new rock art styles. It is argued that this pattern of land and resource use corresponds with that depicted in the ethnohistoric record. Coastal shell middens are a prolific and important archaeological site type in the study area. Analysis of the components of eight unstratified shell middens reveals human exploitation of a wide range of marine resources, including shellfish, scale fish and turtles dating from the mid to late Holocene. Artefactual stone and culturally modified shell, such as baler shell dishes, knives and pendants and giant clam shell adzes, was found in all midden sites. In this thesis, it is argued that a relative chronology can be established for shell middens in Cape Range peninsula on the basis of their landform context, and that significant variation exists between middens that occur in different landform types. Relative ages for these landforms and the middens that occur in them derive from geo-environmental data and radiometric determinations obtained from shell from midden sites occurring within each of the landform types. This thesis also presents an analysis of the impact of severe weather on coastal archaeological sites. The occurrence of Tropical Cyclone Vance presented an opportunity to study in detail the effects of extreme storm conditions on coastal sites in the study area. The results of a post-cyclone survey of sites in the study area demonstrates that the effect of storm surge on coastal midden sites is the single most important factor in extreme cyclonic weather, and that cyclones are arguably the most influential Holocene post-depositional process for coastal archaeological sites in northern Australia. This study places the results of the research within a broader regional context, and addresses the major models and paradigms current in Australian archaeology. It is concluded that although supportive of some archaeological models explaining cultural change in Australia, this research presents new interpretations that challenge some widely accepted views regarding the nature and timing of human occupation during the Holocene in Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Over 9800 borehole logs from the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) and surrounding districts were digitized using GIS and database software and supplemented with 632 borehole logs from the Department of Land and Water Conservation (Leeton) to form the platform for stratigraphic and groundwater investigations conducted in this study. The borehole data were summarised into two sediment classification schemes, the first to delineate the distribution of palaeochannel sediments and the second to assess to spatial distribution of aquitards and aquifers. A series of detailed cross-sections differentiated between at least four distinct palaeochannel sequences identified within the Upper Shepparton Formation overlying the clay-dominated Lower Shepparton Formation. The two deepest sequences, the new Gumblebogie and Ugobit members, comprise thick (3-10 m), laterally extensive (up to 25 km wide) sheets of coarse sandy alluvium that occur to the north of the CIA at depths between 12 to 35 metres below the surface. These deposits are evidence of highly active alluvial phases on the plain, more vigorous than any since. Slightly higher in the sequence (typically 10-20 m depth) is a thick (2-15 m), laterally extensive (up to 10 km wide) mixed-load sequence (the new Duderbang member), which is stratigraphically disconnected from the deeper sanddominated units. Near-surface palaeochannel deposits, which consist of less extensive (up to 3 km wide) coarse sandy alluvium at depth and a combination of mixed- and bedload sequences closer to the surface, make up the youngest palaeochannel deposits in the area.

Dune building in Contents the area occurred in conjunction with channel activity during the Kerarbury (55-35 ka) and Coleambally (105-80 ka) palaeochannel phases (Page et al., 1996) when sediment supply conditions were favourable, probably due to strongly seasonal discharges draining the southeastern highlands.

Pugh:2008masters,"The Lake Heron basin is an intermontane basin located approximately 30 kms west of Mount Hutt. Sediments within the basin are derived from a glacier that passed through the Lake Stream Valley from the upper Rakaia Valley. The lack of major drainage in the south part of the basin has increased the preservation potential of glacial phenomena. The area provides opportunities for detailed glacial geomorphology, sedimentology and micropaleontogical work, from which a very high-resolution study on climate change spanning the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) through to the present was able to be reconstructed. The geomorphology reveals a complex glacial history spanning multiple glaciations. The Pyramid and Dogs Hill Advance are undated but possibly relate to the Waimaungan and Waimean glaciations. The Emily Formation (EM), previously thought to be MIS 4 (Mabin, 1984), was dated using Be10 to c. 25 ka B.P. The EM was largest advance of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Ice during the LGM was at least 150m thicker than previously thought, as indicated by relatively young ages of high elevation moraines. Numerous moraine ridges and kame terraces show a continuous recession from LGM limits, and, supported by decreasing Be10 ages for other LGM moraines, it seems ice retreat was punctuated by minor glacial readvances and still-stands. These may be associated with decadal-scale climate variations, such as the PDO or early ENSO-like systems. There are relatively little sedimentological exposures in the area other than those on the shores of Lake Heron. The sediment at this location demonstrates the nature of glacial and paraglacial sedimentation during the later stages of ice retreat. They show that ice fronts oscillated across several hundred metres before retreating into Lake Heron proper. Vegetation change at Staces Tarn (1200m asl) indicates climate amelioration in the early Holocene. The late glacial vegetation cover of herb and small shrubs was replaced by a low, montane forest about 7,000 yrs B.P, approximately at the time of the regional thermal maxima. From 7,000 and 1,400 yrs B.P, temperatures slowly declined, and grasses slowly moved back onto the site, although the montane forest was still the dominant vegetation. Fires were frequent in the area extending back at least 6,000 years B.P. The largest fire, about 5,300 yrs B.P, caused major forest disruption. But full recovered occurred within about 500 years. Beech forest appears at the site about 3,300 yrs B.P and becomes the dominant forest cover about 1,400 yrs B.P. Cooler, cloudier winters and disturbance by fire promoted the expansion of beech forest at the expense of the previous low, montane forest. Both the increased frequency of fire events and late Holocene beech spread may be linked to ENSO-related variations in rainfall. The youngest zone is characterised by both a dramatic decline in beech forest and an increase in grasses, possibly representing human activity in the area.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Pugh:2010heron,"The Canterbury high country is a favourable location to examine climate-change histories because it lies in the lee of the Southern Alps. This causes the area to be a rain-shadow region and it is sensitive to changes in the strength and persistence of the regional westerly flow. Strong westerly flow is associated with droughts and high summer temperatures. In contrast, weakened westerly flow allows moisture from the east to penetrate these upland basins. As a consequence, this is an important area to study changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds in this sector of the Southern Ocean. This record is unusual because it comes from near the natural tree line and as a consequence should be particularly sensitive to climate change and other environmental forcing. There are a number of significant palaeoecological questions that relate to this setting, including: (1) the persistence of montane podocarp woodland dominated by Phyllocladus and Halocarpus into the Holocene and the timing and cause of its subsequent replacement by beech forest; (2) the role played by fire in controlling vegetation structure and species composition; and (3) human impacts in the high country, especially with the transfer of high-country land into the conservation estate and consequential issues of ecological and landscape management (Armstrong et al. 2005).",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Quigley:2007controls,"Geologic and chronometric studies of alluvial fan sequences in south-central Australia provide insights into the roles of tectonics and climate in continental landscape evolution. The most voluminous alluvial fans in the Flinders Ranges region have developed adjacent to catchments uplifted by Plio-Quaternary reverse faults, implying that young tectonic activity has exerted a first-order control on long-term sediment accumulation rates along the range front. However, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of alluvial fan sequences indicates that late Quaternary facies changes and intervals of sediment aggradation and dissection are not directly correlated with individual faulting events. Fan sequences record a transition from debris flow deposition and soil formation to clast-supported conglomeritic sedimentation by ∼30 ka. This transition is interpreted to reflect a landscape response to increasing climatic aridity, coupled with large flood events that episodically stripped previously weathered regolith from the landscape. Late Pleistocene to Holocene cycles of fan incision and aggradation post-date the youngest-dated surface ruptures and are interpreted to reflect changes in the frequency and magnitude of large floods. These datasets indicate that tectonic activity controlled long-term sediment supply but climate governed the spatial and temporal patterns of range-front sedimentation. Mild intraplate tectonism appears to have influenced Plio-Quaternary sedimentation patterns across much of the southern Australian continent, including the geometry and extent of alluvial fans and sea-level incursions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Quigley:2007flinders,"Cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in exposed bedrock surfaces and alluvial sediment in the northern Flinders Ranges reveal surprisingly high erosion rates for a supposedly ancient and stable landscape. Bedrock erosion rates increase with decreasing elevation in the Yudnamutana Catchment, from summit surfaces (13·96 ± 1·29 and 14·38 ± 1·40 m Myr−1), to hillslopes (17·61 ± 2·21 to 29·24 ± 4·38 m Myr−1), to valley bottoms (53·19 ± 7·26 to 227·95 ± 21·39 m Myr−1), indicating late Quaternary increases to topographic relief. Minimum cliff retreat rates (9·30 ± 3·60 to 24·54 ± 8·53 m Myr−1) indicate that even the most resistant parts of cliff faces have undergone significant late Quaternary erosion. However, erosion rates from visibly weathered and varnished tors protruding from steep bedrock hillslopes (4·17 ± 0·42 to 14·00 ± 1·97 m Myr−1) indicate that bedrock may locally weather at rates equivalent to, or even slower than, summit surfaces. 10Be concentrations in contemporary alluvial sediment indicate catchment‐averaged erosion at a rate dominated by more rapid erosion (22·79 ± 2·78 m Myr−1), consistent with an average rate from individual hillslope point measurements. Late Cenozoic relief production in the Yudnamutana Catchment resulted from (1) tectonic uplift at rates of 30–160 m Myr−1 due to range‐front reverse faulting, which maintained steep river gradients and uplifted summit surfaces, and (2) climate change, which episodically increased both in situ bedrock weathering rates and frequency–magnitude distributions of large magnitude floods, leading to increased incision rates. These results provide quantitative evidence that the Australian landscape is, in places, considerably more dynamic than commonly perceived.

Quigley:2007intraplate,"Cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in bedrock and alluvium combined with structural studies provide a novel approach for identifying neotectonic forcing of landscape evolution in mildly deforming continental interiors. Measured 10Be concentrations in the Flinders Ranges indicate rapid and spatially variable rates of bedrock erosion in a catchment that has incurred at least three large, surface-rupturing earthquakes since ∼ 67 ka. 10Be-derived erosion rates are lower where late Quaternary neotectonic activity is reduced or absent, implying that 10Be concentration may act as a ‘tracer’ for disequilibrium landscapes responding to recent tectonism. Mechanisms for elevated erosion rates include (1) headward migration of fault-generated bedrock knickpoints and resultant oversteepening of stream profiles and catchment hillslopes and (2) liberation of bedrock material from catchment hillslopes via co-seismic shaking. Despite climatic influences on sediment production and transport, this study shows that tectonism can provide a dominant control on bedrock erosion rate and relief production in unglaciated mountain belts, even in intraplate settings where rates of crustal deformation are mild and earthquake activity is episodic.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Quock:2022hurricanes,"Tropical islands, including many in island arcs, are subjected to recurring disturbances from extreme storms such as tropical cyclones. To test whether such storms influence cosmogenic nuclide concentrations such that they do not reflect long-term rates of erosion, we measured meteoric and in situ 10Be in river sediment samples from Dominica, an andesitic island in the Caribbean, before and after category five Hurricane Maria (in 2017). Populations of before- and after-storm concentrations are statistically indistinguishable (n = 7 pairs for in-situ 10Be, n = 11 pairs for meteoric 10Be). 10Be concentrations vary from −138% to +73% within before–after sample pairs relative to the mean of the pair. These new data suggest that the effects of extreme storms on the depth and amount of near-surface erosion on Dominica vary spatially. Our data support the calculations of Niemi et al. (2005) and Yanites et al. (2009) suggesting that basin-by-basin comparisons of erosion rates based on cosmogenic nuclides should be approached with caution in small (<~100 km2) watersheds affected by mass movements and extreme storms.

Rades:2015graben,"The Tangra Yum Co graben is one of the active structures that accommodate the east‐west extension of the southern Tibetan Plateau and hosts one of the largest Tibetan lakes, which experienced lake‐level changes of ~200 m during the Holocene. In this study, cosmogenic 10Be is employed to: (1) quantify catchment‐wide denudation rates in fault‐bounded mountain ranges adjacent to the Tangra Yum Co graben; (2) date palaeo‐shorelines related to the Holocene lake‐level decline; and (3) determine the age of glacial advances in this region. The fault‐bounded, non‐glaciated mountain range north of Tangra Yum Co – and presumably most other areas around the lake – erode at low rates of 10–70 mm/ka. Owing to the slow erosion of the landscape, the sediments delivered to Tangra Yum Co have high 10Be concentrations. As a consequence, accurate exposure dating of sediment‐covered terraces and beach ridges is difficult, because the pre‐depositional 10Be concentration may exceed the post‐depositional 10Be concentration from which exposure ages are calculated. This difficulty is illustrated by a rather inaccurate 10Be exposure age of 2.3 ± 1.4 ka (i.e. an error of 60\%) for a terrace that is located 67 m above the lake. Nevertheless, the age is consistent with luminescence ages for a series of beach ridges and provides further evidence for the decline of the lake level in the late Holocene. At Tangra Yum Co exposure dating of beach ridges via 10Be depth profiles is not feasible, because the pre‐depositional 10Be component in these landforms varies with depth, which violates a basic assumption of this approach. 10Be ages for boulders from two moraines are much older than the early Holocene lake‐level highstand, indicating that melting of glaciers in the mountain ranges adjacent to Tangra Yum Co has not contributed significantly to the lake‐level highstand in the early Holocene.

Rafter:1973radiocarbon,"A uniform approach, based upon the statistical behavior of random measurement errors, is suggested for assessing the relative merit of alternative methods of measuring radiocarbon and for interpreting and reporting the results of such measuremnts. The need for an objective, uniform approach is manifest because of the increasing concern with results which are close to the limits of precision or detection of the dating procedures. The standard deviation of the estimated net signal (sample counts) is first examined in terms of its dependence upon random errors arising in observations of background and gross sample counts. Because of the high precision characterizing such observations, it becomes vital to evaluate random errors additional to the Poisson (counting) errors. The ability to discriminate between samples of similar age, and minimum and maximum detectable ages are discussed in terms of the statistical theory of hypothesis testing. An explicit approach results for the uniform treatment of detection, detectability and age limits. The performance characteristic of alternative measurement methods cannot simply be stated in erms of a single ‘figure of merit‘, because f the rather complex dependence upon counting times, sample, background and modern standard counting rates, and non-Poisson sources of random errors. A ‘reduced activity‘ (sample activity/background equialent activity) plot is offered as a means for planning experiments and for rapidly assessing the capabilities of any specific measurement procedure. As a result of the particular choice of variables for this plot, alternative procedures may be represented by points in a fixed, two-dimensional array, where simple translations of the entire array correspond to changes in counting time or sample age.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Raven:2017deepwater,"Lake sediments are an important resource that can be used to reconstruct past climate and environmental conditions from all over the world. Understanding past climate changes is extremely important to help understand what's happening to climate in Australia today and potentially into the future. The perched lake systems on Fraser Island in subtropical Queensland, Australia, act as natural rainfall gauges, allowing them to be highly sensitive to environmental changes which, through a variety of indicators, are recorded in the sediments. Deepwater Lake, a small perched lake on Fraser Island, was investigated using a range of environmental proxies. A detailed chronology was created using a range of accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates and 210Pb dates on cores taken to a depth of 4.7 m. The chronology indicates an age range of 4800 cal BP to present. The lake sediments were analysed for carbon isotope ratios, carbon/nitrogen ratio variation, macro-charcoal changes, sediment organic content, magnetic susceptibility, XRF based element geochemistry, 210Pb, and radiocarbon dating. These proxies are used to reflect the changes of catchment processes within the lake environment over the mid to late-Holocene. The proxies reflect a transition from a dry, fire-prone environment, with very low organic content from 4800-3800 cal BP, to a more rainfall-erosional based environment from 3800-300 cal BP. During the period from 3800-3000 cal BP, it was determined there was a high influx of detrital sediments, organic content, and a transition from an algal based source to a more terrestrial based organic source. Environmental conditions have remained consistent from 3000 cal BP to present day with very little variation observed in the proxies indicating a stabilisation of climate into the late Holocene.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

The age can then be calculated once the dose rate is known. The method is tested successfully on known-age aeolian sediments retaining their original bedding, but reveals some difficulties in trying to use TL to date aeolian sediments for which the original bedding has been destroyed.

Rees:2015dobson,"The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) profoundly influence synoptic-scale climate in the Southern Hemisphere. Although many studies have invoked either phenomenon to explain trends in proxy data, few have demonstrated the transition from a climate dominated by SWW flow to one controlled by El Niño activity, which is postulated to have occurred after 5 cal ka BP in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Tasmania, southeast Australia, is ideally situated to detect changes in both of these climatic controls. Currently, El Niño and La Niña events result in drier and wetter conditions island-wide, respectively, with the greatest impact in the north. Further, Tasmania houses north--south trending mountain ranges near its western coast. As a result, areas west of the mountains exhibit a positive correlation between SWW flow and precipitation, while eastern regions possess either no or a negative relationship. Here, we present data from chironomid remains, charcoal, and geochemical proxies to investigate the paleohydrological history of Lake Dobson, a site located in Mount Field National Park, Tasmania. The proxies revealed three broad periods: (1) an early Holocene (11.5--8.3 cal kyr BP) characterised by generally high rainfall, the occurrence of irregular fires, and elevated charcoal influx at 11.4 and 10.2 cal ka BP -- conditions compatible with attenuated SWW flow over the site; (2) an ambiguous mid-Holocene (8.3--5 cal kyr BP) that marks the transition from a SWW- to ENSO-dominated climate; and (3) a relatively dry and stable late Holocene (5 cal kyr BP to present) that is consistent with the onset of a climate controlled by ENSO activity (i.e., characterised by a more mean El Niño climate state).

Regalla:2013tohoku,"Convexities in the longitudinal profiles of actively incising rivers are typically considered to represent the morphologic signal of a transient response to external perturbations in tectonic or climatic forcing. Distinguishing such knickzones from those that may be anchored to the channel network by spatial variations in rock uplift, however, can be challenging. Here, we combine stream profile analysis, 10Be watershed-averaged erosion rates, and numerical modeling of stream profile evolution to evaluate whether knickzones in the Abukuma massif of northeast Japan represent a temporal or spatial change in rock uplift rate in relation to forearc shortening. Knickzones in channels that drain the eastern flank of the Abukuma massif are characterized by breaks in slope–area scaling and separate low-gradient, alluvial upper-channel segments from high-gradient, deeply-incised lower channel segments. Average erosion rates inferred from 10Be concentrations in modern sediment below knickzones exceed erosion rates above knickzones by 20–50\%. Although profile convexities could be interpreted as a transient response to an increase in rock uplift rate associated with slip on the range-bounding fault, geologic constraints on the initiation of fault slip and the magnitude of displacement cannot be reconciled with a recent, spatially uniform increase in slip rate. Rather, we find that knickzone position, stream profile gradients, and basin averaged erosion rates are best explained by a relatively abrupt spatial increase in uplift rate localized above a flat-ramp transition in the fault system. These analyses highlight the importance of considering spatially non-uniform uplift in the interpretation of stream profile evolution and demonstrate that the adjustment of river profiles to fault displacement can provide constraints on fault geometry in actively eroding landscapes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Rehn:2020thesis,"Fire has long had a pervasive importance in human lives and actively shapes many landscapes on Earth. Fire has a long history of interaction with Australian ecosystems but poses a growing risk as fire conditions become increasingly severe, due in part to anthropogenic climate change. Tropical savannas cover almost one quarter (1.9 million km2) of the Australian land mass, and fire occurs in tropical savannas almost annually. A greater understanding of past fire regimes, and their environmental context, is essential for management and planning in an increasingly fire-prone landscape. Despite the central importance of fire in savanna ecosystems, the region remains understudied in Australian palaeofire research. This thesis combines established visual/microscopic and emerging geochemical methods to create three new multiproxy palaeofire records for three wetland sites in northern Australian savannas. Charcoal from sedimentary records from these sites was separated into three size fractions (>250 μm, 250-125 μm and 125-63 μm) and quantified by stereomicroscope, with aspect ratios and morphotypes recorded to investigate changes in fuel composition over time. Pyrogenic carbon was chemically isolated using hydrogen pyrolysis, with percent carbon measured by elemental analysis with the δ13C value of the pyrogenic carbon measured by isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometry to determine changes in fuel composition over time. The novel combination of (optical) charcoal and (chemical) pyrogenic carbon measures enabled the identification of changes in relative fire intensities in the past, crucial to differentiating between anthropogenic and climatic influences within these palaeofire records. The palaeofire records were placed in a broader geochemical context using sediment elemental composition (using μXRF) and placed in a temporal context through the development of 210Pb and 14C chronologies. The three records are from (i) Marura Sinkhole (eastern Arnhem Land, 13.409°S, 135.774°E), (ii) Big Willum Swamp (Weipa, Cape York Peninsula, 12.657°S, 141.998°E), and (iii) Sanamere Lagoon (Cape York Peninsula, 11.117°S, 142.35°E). The palaeofire record for Marura sinkhole covers approximately 4600 cal BP to present, with highest fire incidence 4600-2800 cal BP. Vegetation at Marura is of mixed tree-grass composition throughout the record, with variability in the fine (<63 μm) fraction. Variable relative fire intensities and divergence between local and regional fire and vegetation signals suggest increasing human influence on fire at Marura from ~2800 cal BP. Minimal charcoal and pyrogenic carbon transport into the site after ~900 cal BP is likely the result of the imposition of fine-scale patch mosaic burning. European arrival in Arnhem Land shows a delayed effect on fire at Marura, with increased fire incidence after ~1950 CE reaching levels not seen in the preceding 900 years. The Big Willum Swamp palaeofire record covers ~3900 cal BP to present, with ephemeral conditions leading to minimal deposition early in the record prior to deepening of the site at ~2200 cal BP. Fire incidence at Big Willum Swamp is low until the last century, peaking at ~1970 CE with high relative fire intensities after the establishment of a bauxite mine around the site. Vegetation is a consistent tree-grass mix throughout the record comparable to modern vegetation across the Weipa Plateau. ... [_truncated_]",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Rehn:2021arnhem,"Fire has a long history in Australia and is a key driver of vegetation dynamics in the tropical savanna ecosystems that cover one quarter of the country. Fire reconstructions are required to understand ecosystem dynamics over the long term but these data are lacking for the extensive savannas of northern Australia.

The record is constructed by combining optical methods (counts and morphology of macroscopic and microscopic charcoal particles) and chemical methods (quantification of abundance and stable isotope composition of pyrogenic carbon by hydrogen pyrolysis). This novel combination of measurements enables the generation of a record of relative fire intensity to investigate the interplay between natural and anthropogenic influences. The Marura palaeofire record comprises three main phases: 4600--2800 cal BP, 2800--900 cal BP and 900 cal BP to present. Highest fire incidence occurs at ~4600--4000 cal BP, coinciding with regional records of high effective precipitation, and all fire proxies decline from that time to the present. 2800--900 cal BP is characterised by variable fire intensities and aligns with archaeological evidence of occupation at nearby Blue Mud Bay. All fire proxies decline significantly after 900 cal BP. The combination of charcoal and pyrogenic carbon measures is a promising proxy for relative fire intensity in sedimentary records and a useful tool for investigating potential anthropogenic fire regimes.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Rehn:2021cape,"Paleoecology has demonstrated potential to inform current and future land management by providing long-term baselines for fire regimes, over thousands of years covering past periods of lower/higher rainfall and temperatures. To extend this potential, more work is required for methodological innovation able to generate nuanced, relevant and clearly interpretable results. This paper presents records from Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia, as a case study where fire management is an important but socially complex modern management issue, and where palaeofire records are limited. Two new multiproxy palaeofire records are presented from Sanamere Lagoon (8,150--6,600 cal BP) and Big Willum Swamp (3,900 cal BP to present). These records combine existing methods to investigate fire occurrence, vegetation types, and relative fire intensity. Results presented here demonstrate a diversity of fire histories at different sites across Cape York Peninsula, highlighting the need for finer scale palaeofire research. Future fire management planning on Cape York Peninsula must take into account the thousands of years of active Indigenous management and this understanding can be further informed by paleoecological research.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

I demonstrate that a level of standardisation of the reduction sequence is evident at the site in several technological and descriptive indices.

Reid:2007murray,"Shallow lakes have been described as existing in two alternative equilibrium states, dominated by either submerged plants or phytoplankton. Causes of, often catastrophic, shifts between these states have been widely debated but may often result from displacement of the dominant community by stochastic influence. In Australian cut-off river meanders (also known as 'billabongs'), anecdotal and palaeolimnological evidence suggests widespread loss of aquatic macrophytes since European occupation of the region c. post-1800. Our detailed and high-resolution stratigraphic study of a sediment core from Hogan's Billabong (Murray River, Australia) seeks to identify the causes of the loss of aquatic macrophytes. Little direct evidence of the past extent and composition of submerged macrophyte communities was recovered. Nevertheless, results derived from other sediment proxies, including declines in the abundance of epiphytic diatoms and in plant-associated invertebrates, provide further indirect evidence of macrophyte disappearance. Despite limitations with radiometric dating, the sequence of events in the derived record suggests that a period of high abiotic turbidity, leading to a critical reduction in water transparency and caused by widespread erosion during the late 19th century, is the most likely factor contributing to loss of submerged vegetation from this billabong.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

This study examined physical, chemical and bio-stratigraphy in refugial waterholes situated along four distributaries of the Lower Balonne River system in semi-arid Australia. In doing so we reconstructed environmental histories for the waterholes, calculated how sedimentation rates have changed in response to land use change over the past two centuries, and assessed whether they are threatened by increased sedimentation through potential effects on waterhole depth and hence persistence times and habitat quality. Our study found that sedimentation rates have increased substantially since European settlement, most likely in response to removal of groundcover by grazers. ...

Reimer:2004intcal,"A new calibration curve for the conversion of radiocarbon ages to calibrated (cal) ages has been constructed and internationally ratified to replace IntCal98, which extended from 0--24 cal kyr BP (Before Present, 0 cal BP = AD 1950). The new calibration data set for terrestrial samples extends from 0--26 cal kyr BP, but with much higher resolution beyond 11.4 cal kyr BP than IntCal98. Dendrochronologically-dated tree-ring samples cover the period from 0--12.4 cal kyr BP. Beyond the end of the tree rings, data from marine records (corals and foraminifera) are converted to the atmospheric equivalent with a site-specific marine reservoir correction to provide terrestrial calibration from 12.4--26.0 cal kyr B P. A substantial enhancement relative to IntCal98 is the introduction of a coherent statistical approach based on a random walk model, which takes into account the uncertainty in both the calendar age and the 14C age to calculate the underlying calibration curve (Buck and Blackwell, this issue). The tree-ring data sets, sources of uncertainty, and regional offsets are discussed here. The marine data sets and calibration curve for marine samples from the surface mixed layer (Marine04) are discussed in brief, but details are presented in Hughen et al. (this issue a).

Although calibration curves are constructed from independently dated archives, they invariably require revision as new data become available and our understanding of the Earth system improves. In this volume the international 14C calibration curves for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as for the ocean surface layer, have been updated to include a wealth of new data and extended to 55,000 cal BP. Based on tree rings, IntCal20 now extends as a fully atmospheric record to ca. 13,900 cal BP. For the older part of the timescale, IntCal20 comprises statistically integrated evidence from floating tree-ring chronologies, lacustrine and marine sediments, speleothems, and corals. We utilized improved evaluation of the timescales and location variable 14C offsets from the atmosphere (reservoir age, dead carbon fraction) for each dataset. New statistical methods have refined the structure of the calibration curves while maintaining a robust treatment of uncertainties in the 14C ages, the calendar ages and other corrections. The inclusion of modeled marine reservoir ages derived from a three-dimensional ocean circulation model has allowed us to apply more appropriate reservoir corrections to the marine 14C data rather than the previous use of constant regional offsets from the atmosphere. Here we provide an overview of the new and revised datasets and the associated methods used for the construction of the IntCal20 curve and explore potential regional offsets for tree-ring data.

Reinhardt:2007spain,"We integrated optically stimulated luminescence dating and 10Be cosmogenic nuclide measurements to quantify short‐to‐medium‐term (102–104 years) catchment dynamics and response to active tectonics. In the 27 km2 Río Torrente catchment, Sierra Nevada, southern Spain, rapid base‐level fall has triggered knickpoint migration up both trunk and tributary channels, resulting in two distinct geomorphic zones: (1) a steep lower catchment with concordant rates of hillslope erosion and channel incision over both short (100 years: 5–8 mm yr−1) and medium (12 ka: 5 ± 1 mm yr−1) timescales and (2) a low‐relief soil‐mantled upland topography with uniformly low bedrock and hillslope erosion rates (0.05 ± 0.02 mm yr−1). The uniformity of erosion in this upland surface indicates that catchment topography was previously in steady state. Rapid river incision below the channel knickpoints has resulted in the development of steep landslide‐dominated hillslopes that are essentially “tracking” the incising channel. The magnitude of base‐level fall required to generate these steep hillslopes is >100 m; at least 50 m of this base‐level fall occurred during the past ∼21 ka. These steep hillslopes are eroding back into the low‐angled upland surface at a much slower rate than the channel knickpoint. Consequently, the trunk channel knickpoint has already reached the catchment headwaters while hillslopes continue to adjust to the new base level, indicating that the channel profile will regain equilibrium form long before hillslopes. Thus hillslopes are the limiting factor for the duration of landscape transience in this small mountain catchment.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Reusser:2015landscape,"Establishing background (geologic) rates of erosion is prerequisite to quantifying the impact of human activities on Earth’s surface. Here, we present 10Be estimates of background erosion rates for ten large (10,000–100,000 km2) river basins in the southeastern United States, an area that was cleared of native forest and used intensively for agriculture. These 10Be-based rates are indicative of the pace at which the North American passive-margin landscape eroded before European settlement (∼8 m/m.y.). Comparing these background rates to both rates of post-settlement hillslope erosion and to river sediment yields for the same basins, we find that following peak disturbance (late 1800s and early 1900s), rates of hillslope erosion (∼950 m/m.y.) exceeded 10Be-determined background rates more than one-hundred fold. Although large-basin sediment yields during peak disturbance increased 5–10× above pre-settlement norms, rivers at the time were transporting only ∼6\% of the eroded material; work by others suggests that the bulk of historically eroded material remained and still remains as legacy sediment stored at the base of hillslopes and along valley bottoms. Because background erosion rates, such as we present here, reflect the rate at which soil is generated over millennial time scales, they can inform and enhance landscape-management strategies.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This drainage divide is contained in one of the higher portions of Mantiqueira Mountain Range and coincides with NNW flank of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil. For this study nine sub-basins were selected in the extreme south of Minas Gerais, between the municipalities of Itamonte and Bocaina de Minas. These catchments had their denudational rates estimated by measuring the production of cosmogenic nuclide 10Be in fluvial sediments. The results show that the average denudation rate of the sub-basins of the Paraiba do Sul river, facing the gráben (17,39 m/Ma), is greater than that of sub-basins of the Grande and Aiuruoca rivers, directed to continental interior (12,24 m/Ma). Among the control factors of the denudation rates, stands out a good correlation between rates and two morphometric parameters: relief amplitude and average slope of the catchments. The influence of lithology is also important, since the resistance of granite to erosion processes is one of the factors conditioning denudational rates fairly low in the area. The results indicate that the Maromba granite is the more resistant lithological unit among those present in the sampled sub-basins. The low rates measured, concerning the last tens of thousands of years, contrasts with the rejuvenated relief and with the high altitudes of this sector of the Mantiqueira Range, where there is a recognized role of neotectonics in morphogenesis. In this way, it is likely that there was an attenuation of tectonic activity in the Upper Quaternary, with the consequent stabilization of base levels and decrease of denudational processes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Rhodes:2010hearths,"Research conducted by the Western New South Wales Archaeology Program (WNSWAP) provides the opportunity to assess the reliability of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of late Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial sediments and burnt stone samples from arid zone geoarchaeological contexts. A large number of radiocarbon age determinations of charcoal preserved in heat retainer hearths provides independent chronological control at these contexts. We describe a rapid OSL methodology for dating burnt hearth stones to complement previously applied radiocarbon methods, which we have tested using 37 samples from hearths with radiocarbon determinations. We propose a geoarchaeological model in which these hearths were constructed by people whose activity took place on an archaeological surface, formed by the earlier deposition of fluvial sediments. Here we demonstrate the veracity of this model by dating sediments lying stratigraphically below the hearths, and use the radiocarbon age control and chronological consistency to assess the accuracy and reliability of both small aliquot and single grain single aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) OSL dating. While small aliquot age estimates are in most cases in agreement with independent control, the single grain determinations using a finite mixture model (FMM) appear to provide improved chronological resolution. Using single grains, we note some problems in the application of the FMM and in the dating of young samples in the range of 1–100 years. As many samples may have resided close to the surface since deposition, we have developed a mathematical function to describe gamma and cosmic dose rate contributions at burial depths down to 40cm. These OSL age estimates allow us to reject the model of intensification of human activity as responsible for the observed pattern of archaeological radiocarbon determinations in this part of the Australian arid zone.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

These ideas have had significant impacts on thinking within the fields of geomorphology, biogeography, archaeology, anthropology and history. Papers presented here continue to explore the dynamism of landscape change in Australia and the contribution of humans to those transformations. The volume is structured in two sections. The first examines evidence for human engagement with landscape, focusing on Australia and Papua New Guinea but also dealing with the human/environmental histories of Europe and Asia. ...

Richards:2013thesis,"The ongoing international debate regarding complexity in Southwest Victorian Aboriginal societies concerns unresolved issues surrounding the validity of the 19th century ethnographic record and the nature of archaeological evidence for complexity in the pre-contact period. This thesis critically re-examines SW Victorian Aboriginal societies with the aid of substantial new empirical data and by exploring the ethnographic and archaeological records through the theoretical lens of Hayden‘s concept of transegalitarian socio-cultural complexity. It is contended that evidence for transegalitarian complexity is indisputably present in the ethnographic period and appears as early as the onset of the middle Holocene in the archaeological record of SW Victoria. Data from shell middens, including numerous radiocarbon age determinations, in the Cape Duquesne study area and other nearby localities are used to develop a 12,000 year long coastal archaeological sequence. Much of this period was characterised by small-scale, short-term shellfishing camps associated with the collection of individual, mobile, large shellfish. At c. 4000 cal BP there was a dramatic change with the appearance of permanent, focal coastal settlements resulting from highly organised, tightly scheduled, seasonal occupation by larger groups that stayed on the coast for longer periods. These groups utilised a broader range of shellfish species than previously while focusing on the mass collection and processing of one small, sessile species, Paphies angusta. These characteristics became more pronounced after c. 1500 cal BP. The direct historical approach is employed at the Lake Condah Outlet study area to investigate the archaeological manifestation of an ethnohistorically chronicled Aboriginal eel fishery. The late 19th century map and text, produced on the basis of first-hand observations plus information from traditional owners, provides invaluable information on the operation of a series of weirs, channels and traps as a water control and eel management system. Detailed archaeological mapping and recording of the still extant 19th century cultural features forms the basis for modelling the functioning of this system at varying lake levels, documenting the culture-based fishery form of eel aquaculture at the Lake Condah Outlet. This is the economic basis for transegalitarian features throughout SW Victoria in the ethnographic period and well into the pre-contact period. Three SW Victorian Aboriginal mortuary trees, from Moyston, Gorrinn and Cathcart, investigated using archaeological, ethnohistorical and physical anthropological data, are employed to evaluate the regional ethnographic model relating complexity in the staging of mortuary treatment to an individual‘s status during their lifetime. ...

Riebe:2000nevada,"We used cosmogenic 26Al and 10Be in stream sediment to measure landscape-scale erosion rates for topographically diverse catchments at seven Sierra Nevada sites. At three sites, erosion rates and hillslope gradients are strongly correlated, increasing with proximity to fault scarps and river canyons, which appear to have accelerated local base-level lowering rates, and thus increased catchment erosion rates by up to 15-fold. At four other sites, far from fault scarps and river canyons, erosion rates are much more uniform and less sensitive to average hillslope gradient. Our measurements show that contrasts in landscape erosion rates cannot be inferred from hillslope gradients alone, because landscapes can evolve toward a state of erosional equilibrium, in which steep and gentle slopes erode at similar rates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We tested this approach in the Rio Icacos watershed, Puerto Rico, where independent studies have estimated weathering rates over both short and long timescales. Results from the cosmogenic/mass balance method are consistent with three independent sets of weathering rate estimates, thus confirming that this approach yields realistic measurements of long-term weathering rates.  ...

Rieser:2010crater,"Lynch's Crater on the Atherton Tablelands in NE-Australia formed about 230,000 years ago during an explosive eruption, creating a maar more than 80m deep. Since the eruption, the maar has been filled with lake sediments that are topped by peat material. A 64m long core was recovered and an OSL dating project was undertaken to extend the chronology beyond 16m depth, which according to 14C age control represents ∼60ka. The predominantly organic lake sediments contained abundant fine quartz of aeolian origin, and the Single Aliquot Regenerative Method (SAR) provided satisfactory equivalent dose (DE) estimates. However, the determination of the dose rate proved both critical and difficult. Extremely low radionuclide contents led to cosmic radiation being the dominant dose rate contribution for most samples. The OSL chronology presented in this paper thus relies on modelling the changing cover by sediments and lake water over the burial time.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Riley:2020staircase,"Most streams in the Southwest United States are ephemeral and can be sensitive to climate change given the delicate balance between sediment supply and discharge. These streams undergo rapid geomorphic change because of the semi-arid climate, high sediment supply, and flashy hydrology. At the turn of the 20th century, many streams in the region rapidly incised into their floodplains forming arroyos stimulating questions regarding the cause of such widespread synchronous channel change. Arroyos are a geomorphic form where a channel is entrenched into fine-grained cohesive alluvium with near vertical channel banks. This dissertation investigates Holocene and late Pleistocene geomorphic change in catchments draining the Grand Staircase region of the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah with the goal of understanding how climate variability and sediment supply influence channel change, landscape evolution, and wildfire history. Methods and datasets used include field descriptions of stratigraphy and sedimentology, geospatial analysis, optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating, cosmogenic nuclide 10Be concentrations of modern, Holocene, and Pleistocene alluvium, and alluvial charcoal derived fire records. ...

Ringrose:1996dalmore,"This work describes and provides tentative dates for a previously briefly recorded calcrete suite from semi-arid north-central Australia. The aim is to provide further insight into the nature of carbonate deposition in this area and thereby promote further research. The calcrete deposit occupies 3750 km2and appears to have once served as a conduit for groundwater flow towards the Barkly Tablelands playa system. Two major phases of calcrete precipitation are distinguished tentatively as occurring during the Mid- and Late Pleistocene. Geomorphological and SEM evidence suggest that an earlier phase culminated in the direct calcium carbonate precipitation of travertine mounds. These resulted from effusive groundwater flow, possibly along spring lines. This phase was succeeded by a period of longitudinal dune formation. During a later phase, non-pedogenic calcrete was precipitated between and beyond the mounds, apparently replacing former dunes. The presence of salts within the calcrete infers strong evaporative conditions suggesting that this later precipitation took place in the proximity of a saline lake, possibly palaeo-lake Barkly. Later stage aeolian activity appears to have reworked dune surfaces since the second stage of carbonate deposition.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We now report thermoluminescence (TL) dates that suggest the arrival of people between 50 and 60 kyr in northern Australia. TL dates were obtained from sandy footslope deposits at two former occupation sites that yielded a range of stone artefacts in their primary depositional setting. Artefacts terminated mid-way down one profile, which had a basal age of about 100 kyr. Confidence in the TL dates is given by their close correspondence with radiocarbon dates obtained from the upper occupation levels.

Roberts:1991phd,"The Magela Creek catchment is situated in tropical northern Australia. This thesis examines the contemporary sediment transport regime of the sand-bed Magela Creek, the Holocene alluviation of its palaeochannel, the Quaternary history of extensive colluvial sand aprons developed along the flanks of the Arnhem Land plateau, and the chronology of isolated alluvial and lacustrine deposits on the plateau surface. Catchment sediment budgets are constructed at contemporary (AD 1950-1989), Holocene (0-7 kyr) and Pleistocene (7-20 kyr) timescales, and a sedimentation chronology for the sand aprons extended back to ∼240 kyr. Contemporary sediment and solute transport rates in the Magela Creek were measured between 1986 and 1989. The measured bedload transport rates compare favourably with those computed by the van Rijn (1984c) model and the mean computed yield for 1980-1989 (1800 m3/yr) corresponds closely to the rate of infilling of Mudginberri Billabong determined for the same period from air photo and bathymetric surveys (1400-2100 m3/yr). Annual yields of washload and solutes are estimated using rating curves. Over the 1971-1989 period, the total terrigenous load transported by the Magela Creek (∼12,000 t/yr) consisted of approximately 30% bedload, 15% suspended sand, 45% washload and 10% solutes. The sand fraction is larger than that commonly reported for tropical rivers. It is derived almost entirely from the Arnhem Land plateau and corresponds to a plateau erosion rate of ∼5 m3/km2/yr. Washload and solutes are derived mostly from the lowlands and their yields equate with a lowland denudation rate of ∼28 m3/km2/yr, which lies at the low end of the range reported for other tropical savanna regions. The difference between the two rates suggests that the relative elevation of the plateau is increasing with time. Sand transported along the Magela palaeochannel prior to ∼8 kyr was discharged into the deep-water estuary that existed at what is now Mudginberri Billabong. Infilling of the palaeochannel began at ∼8 kyr with the downstream progradation of a sand wedge. This sand probably was supplied by gullying of nearby sand aprons, associated with the return of enhanced monsoonal activity to the region during the post-glacial marine transgression. The palaeochannel subsequently accreted vertically, although the rate of infilling over the last 3 kyr was double that of the preceding 4 kyr. Sand aprons, dated by thermoluminescence, began to develop at the foot of the Arnhem Land escarpment at 220-230 kyr and 100-120 kyr: these ages coincide with the start of the penultimate and last interglacials respectively. Since then, the aprons have accumulated at a fairly constant rate (30-70 rnm/kyr). The basal ages of the aprons and their volumetric rates of accumulation imply an escarpment retreat rate of 20-200 rnm/kyr, in contrast to a plateau lowering rate of ∼5 rnm/kyr (inferred from the rate of infilling an enclosed ephemeral lake in the catchment headwaters). The dominance of escarpment retreat over plateau lowering by a factor of 4-40 accords with the classic theories of parallel retreat of slopes rather than the downwasting of interfluves.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Roberts:1994newlight,"Since these words were written by Etheridge, more than a century ago, considerable evidence has been amassed in favour of a great antiquitv for human presence in Australia. Proof of this antiquitv had to wait, however, until the advent of physical dating methods in archaeology. The initial insights were provided by radiocarbon (14C) dating of organic remains found at human occupation sites, and they transformed our knowledge of Australian prehistory. A full account of this 'radiocarbon revolution' has been chronicled by Jones (1989, 1993). The first direct date for Pleistocene occupation was obtained from Kenniff Cave in southern Queensland (Mulvanev 1962), but, by the end of the 1960s, ages of 20,000-30,000 radiocarbon years had been reported for sites around the continent. The next decade saw the date for initial colonisation extend back to 38,000 radiocarbon years, based on finds at Lake Mungo in western New South Wales, and near Perth in Western Australia. Some prehistorians (eg Jones 1982) have long regarded such 14C ages as minimum ages for colonisation, as they lie near the limit of the method, while others (such as Allen 1989) have recently asserted that first landfall need not have occurred earlier than 35,000 years ago.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Roberts:1994optical,"The date at which people entered Australia has important implications for the debate on modern human origins. Thermoluminescence dates of 50-60 ka, reported for initial occupation of the Malakunanja II site in northern Australia, have been used as a means of calibrating the rate of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evolution in modern humans. Optical dating of unburnt quartzose sediments from a rock shelter site (Nauwalabila I, Lindner Site) in Deaf Adder Gorge, 70 km south of Malakunanja II, provides new evidence for the timing of the colonisation of the continent. Optical dates were determined for several stratigraphic levels within a 3 m deep excavation, in which flaked stone artefacts and ground pigments were found in primary depositional setting. The lowest human occupation levels are bracketed by dates of 53.4 ± 5.4 ka and 60.3 ± 6.7 ka, while the upper levels show good agreement between optical and calibrated 14C age estimates. High-quality haematite with ground facets and striations is associated directly with the 53 ka level and indicates the use of pigments by these early Australians. The optical dates independently confirm evidence for the colonisation of northern Australia shortly after 60 ka and should be seen in the context of this region as having been a likely entry route for the first human movements into Sahul.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Here we report substantially younger optical ages for quartz sand, and ages based on measurements of radioactive carbon in charcoal fragments, from the occupation deposit. Using conventional (multiple-grain) optical dating methods, we estimate that the base of the deposit is 22 kyr. However, dating of individual grains shows that some have been buried more recently. The single-grain optical ages indicate that the Jinmium deposit is younger than 10 kyr. This result is in agreement with the late-Holocene ages obtained for the upper two-thirds of the deposit from radiocarbon measurements.

Roberts:2022fossils,"Oceania is a key region for studying human dispersals, adaptations and interactions with other hominin populations. Although archaeological evidence now reveals occupation of the region by approximately 65-45 000 years ago, its human fossil record, which has the best potential to provide direct insights into ecological adaptations and population relationships, has remained much more elusive. Here, we apply radiocarbon dating and stable isotope approaches to the earliest human remains so far excavated on the islands of Near and Remote Oceania to explore the chronology and diets of the first preserved human individuals to step across these Pacific frontiers. We demonstrate that the oldest human (or indeed hominin) fossil outside of the mainland New Guinea-Aru area dates to approximately 11 800 years ago. Furthermore, although these early sea-faring populations have been associated with a specialized coastal adaptation, we show that Late Pleistocene-Holocene humans living on islands in the Bismarck Archipelago and in Vanuatu display a persistent reliance on interior tropical forest resources. We argue that local tropical habitats, rather than purely coasts or, later, arriving domesticates, should be emphasized in discussions of human diets and cultural practices from the onset of our species‘ arrival in this part of the world.

Roberts:2022morphological,"In this article we present the results of a morphological analysis of four mostly complete non-returning boomerangs and one shaped wooden fragment recovered in 2017 and 2018 from Cooper Creek near Innamincka in South Australia‘s far northeast. This archaeological collection forms one of only six known/published wooden artefact assemblages in the country. We also detail the results of the direct accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon (AMS 14C) measurement of the artefacts which range from circa 275-175 BP (1650-1830 cal AD, median ages reported). Given that the age estimates obtained for the artefacts are from the recent period, we have complemented the morphological analysis by interpreting the assemblage within the context of ethnohistorical records and Traditional Owner knowledge. The assemblage reveals a variety of forms and functions representative of the diverse cultural activities and daily lives of the Aboriginal people who lived near significant waterholes in the Cooper Creek region during this period. The boomerangs also preserve manufacture and use-wear traces, providing insights into the life histories of each implement. In addition to their likely use as projectiles, our results indicate that the boomerangs were probably used for fighting, hunting, digging, fire management and possibly in ceremonies. Predictions for climate change in the region threaten to alter the conditions that allowed the preservation of these artefacts which may negatively affect the potential survival of other wooden objects that remain in the environment.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Roberts:2022serrated,"This article describes three freshwater mussel shell artefacts recently documented for the Murray River in South Australia. These finds more than double the known examples of such artefacts from this region. Two of the modified shells are perforated, with the other serrated. The finely serrated item is a rare artefact and we have not located any similar published examples in Australia, although international correlates exist. The function/s and cultural significance of the objects are also considered in this paper. Hypotheses for the perforated finds include ornamentation, tool stringing and fibre scraping. Ornamentation, idle tinkering and food utensil use are considered as possible intended functions for the serrated artefact. Given the age range of the objects reported here (c. 6181-517 cal BP), together with other finds in the Murray Darling Basin, we tentatively suggest that shells have been a material resource used continually in this region for a range of purposes. However, as argued by other researchers, we concur that there has probably been infrequent identification and reporting of such shell artefacts. This is considered particularly likely given that our finds were recovered from relatively small scale excavation/coring and surface sampling efforts. As such, this paper attempts to raise awareness of this form of material culture in archaeological sequences.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Robertson:2006luminescence,"Roonka, the Aboriginal habitation and burial site on the River Murray, South Australia, was excavated from 1968 to 1983. In 1983, thermoluminescence (TL) ages were obtained for several fireplaces at the East Bank site. Sandy dune sediments collected from East Bank were also analysed using traditional TL methods and ages were found at depths down to the base at 2.6 m. Now, 20 years on, with optical dating methods well established, it seemed instructive to repeat the measurements using new techniques, specifically the single aliquot regeneration dose protocol. This has provided confirmation of the TL ages and provided an age framework for both the archaeological and geological aspects of Roonka. The ages confirm the archaeological description of the structure of the dune and show that only the top 20 percent is the Holocene Bunyip formation. The lower part is assigned to the Woorinen Formation, formed during and after the last glacial maximum. Burials at East Bank took place between about 16 and 20 ka, substantially earlier than those on the Roonka Flat, but consistent with the earliest evidence of occupation on the Flat.

The distinctiveness of the coastal area in a regional Aboriginal perspective is established. The characteristics of the archaeological evidence are described for twelve selected areas, and comparisons with the historic record and contemporary Aboriginal knowledge are made. The archaeological evidence includes shell scatters, mounded shell middens, wells and fishtraps. Dates obtained from three sites range from 1,300BP to 140BP.

Robins:1999clocks,"There is no basic temporal framework for Aboriginal occupation on the middle and upper reaches of the Paroo River. This paper describes exploratory archaeological research in Currawinya National Park and an adjacent property to identify dateable archaeological sites. Climatic changes in the arid zone over the potential period (more than 50,000 years) of human occupation has been considerable, particularly the Last Glacial Macimum from about 25,000 to about 10,000 years ago, when conditions were considerably more arid. The Aboriginal response to these changes is unknown. To begin to understand the chronology of Aboriginal occupation, dates were obtained from six hearts, one rockshelter and two open sites. Apart fom hardpan sites, all the surface or near surface evidence was dated to the last 2,000 years. Artefacts in hardpan deposits were dated to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene (about 14,000 to 8,000 years ago). Youlain Springs had a record of continuous occupation from the late Pleistocene (about 14,000 years ago) to the late Holocene (‘modern‘). The results indicate that much of the land surfaces and sites are relatively recent - less than 2,000 years old. Surface sites can be interpreted as part of a contemporaneous, interconnected system. We therefore need to develop management that acknowledges relationships between sites as well as the sites themselves. Small sites as well as large sites are important if we are to develop an idea of how Aboriginal people utilised this environment. However, it is also clear that Aboriginal peoples have had a long association with this particular river system that extends at least 14,000 years to the end of the Pleistocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Roche:1999bones,"In this thesis I present an analysis of the vertebrate faunal assemblage from Hay Cave, a site in the Mitchell-Palmer region of south-east Cape York, north Queensland.  I propose that the vertebrate faunal evidence from Hay Cave is indicative of a high degree of stability in gross vegetation patterns.  After viewing this information in light of other data from the site, it appears that the relatively stable vegetation patterns at Hay Cave reflect the limited extent of climatic fluctuations within the Mitchell-Palmer region from c.29,700BP until the present. Furthermore, I argue that the congruity between the vegetation patterns apparent at Hay Cave and those identified at Lake Koongirra and Lake Carpentaria supports Rowe’s (1998) hypothesis that the degree of environmental change in western south-east Cape York was comparatively limited.The analysis of the vertebrate faunal assemblage is also used to examine changes in patterns of human activity at Hay Cave and indicates that alterations in the intensities of human use of the site broadly concur with the regional sequence of cultural change.  In addition, although the magnitude of climatic alterations may have been low at Hay Cave, these changes had an impact on the intensity with which people used the site prior to c.3,100BP.  This hypothesis largely corresponds with models of archaeological change in south-east Cape York (David and Lourandos 1997; Morwood and Hobbs 1995a).  However, I argue that, during the late Holocene, patterns of site use diverge from the prevailing environmental conditions and thus Morwood and Hobbs’s (1995a) theory is not applicable at Hay Cave during this period.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The erosional response to uplift is well-represented by river incision and the associated landslide activity. However, characterising the relationship between these processes remains a major challenge in tectonically active areas, in some cases because landslides can preclude obtaining reliable erosion rates from cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) concentrations.

Rogers:2007frequency,"Our evaluation of pre-settlement Holocene (10 000--1000 BP) fire, using radiocarbon-dated charcoals and pollen and charcoal spectra in pollen diagrams, concludes that fires were infrequent and patchy in the eastern South Island of New Zealand. Charcoal radiocarbon dates point to three broad phases of fire frequency: infrequent patchy fires from 10 000 to 2600 BP; a slightly increased frequency between 2600 and 1000 BP; and an unprecedented increase of fires after 1000 BP, which peaked between 800 and 500 BP. We suggest that natural fire was driven more by vegetation flammability (with ignitibility and combustibility components) than climate within this rain-shadow region, that plant chemistry principally determined fire frequency, and that topography determined the extent of fire. The review suggests that there were rare spatial and temporal instances of a feedback relationship between fire and early-successional grasses in eastern South Island. This occurred only within narrow-range, cool environments, whose equilibrium communities were of flammable, phenolic-rich woody species and grasses, and was predominantly in the late pre-settlement period. Elsewhere, grasses and herbs were understorey components to otherwise low-flammability, hardwood forest and scrub.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Roller:2012rwenzori,"High relief and steep topography are thought to result in high erosion rates. In the Rwenzori Mountains of the Albert Rift, East Africa, where more than 3 km of relief have formed during uplift of the Rwenzori fault block, overall low denudation rates prevail. We measured in situ-derived cosmogenic denudation rates of 28.2 to 131 mm/kyr in mountainous catchments, and rates of 7.8 to 17.7 mm/kyr on the adjacent low-relief East African Plateau. These rates are roughly an order of magnitude lower than in other settings of similar relief. We present an extensive geomorphological analysis, and find that denudation rates are positively correlated with relief, hillslope gradient, and channel steepness, indicating that river incision controls erosional processes. In most upper headwater reaches above Quaternary ELA levels (>4500 m a.s.l.), glacial imprinting, inherited from several older and recent minor glaciation stages, prevails. In regions below 4500 m a.s.l., however, mild climatic conditions impede frost shattering, favor dense vegetation, and minimize bare rock areas and associated mass wasting. We conclude that erosion of the Rwenzori Mountains is significantly slower than corresponding rates in other mountains of high relief, due to a combination of factors: extremely dense mountain cloud forest vegetation, high rock strength of gneiss and amphibolite lithologies, and low internal fracturing due to the extensional tectonic setting. This specific combination, unique to this extensional tropical setting, leads to unexpected low erosion rates that cannot outpace post-Pliocene ongoing rock uplift of the Rwenzori fault block.

Romanin:2016transition,"Using pollen and charcoal analysis we examined how vegetation and fire regimes have changed over the last 600 years in the Midlands of Tasmania. Sediment cores from seven lagoons were sampled, with a chronology developed at one site (Diprose Lagoon) using 210Pb and 14C dating. Statistical contrasts of six cores where Pinus served as a marker of European settlement in the early 19th Century and showed significant changes in pollen composition following settlement with (a) influx of ruderal exotic taxa including Plantago lanceolata L., Brassicaceae, Asteraceae (Liguliflorae) and Rumex, (b) increase in pollen of the aquatics Myriophyllum spp. and Cyperaceae, (c) a decline in native herbaceous pollen taxa, including Chenopodiaceae and Asteraceae (Tubuliflorae) and (d) a decline in Allocasuarina and an initial decline and then increase of Poaceae. The presence of Asteraceae (Liguliflorae) in the pre-European period suggests that an important root vegetable Microseris lanceolata (Walp.) Sch.Bip. may have been abundant. Charcoal deposition was low in the pre-European period and significantly increased immediately after European arrival. Collectively, these changes suggest substantial ecological impacts following European settlement including cessation of Aboriginal traditions of fire management, a shift in hydrological conditions from open water lagoons to more ephemeral herb covered lagoons, and increased diversity of alien herbaceous species following pasture establishment.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Romano:2018reduced,"A fundamental tenet of human land management is to create spatial and temporal predictability in an environment to improve subsistence. Detecting the relationship between humans and their environment in the palaeo-record is confounded by a number of factors, not the least of which is an adequate pairing of the scales of both the palaeoecological and archaeological records. We aimed to determine the impact, if any, of Aboriginal occupation on the environment surrounding an occupation site in northwest Tasmania, Australia. We analysed the sediments within two small wetlands in northwest Tasmania for pollen, charcoal and loss-on-ignition: (1) a high intensity occupation site --with direct evidence of human occupation; and (2) a low intensity occupation site --with no direct evidence of human occupation. Fire activity and environmental variability covaried at both sites in response to regional climatic change, except between ca. 1700-900 cal yr BP. This period is synchronous with peak human population growth in the region derived from statistical manipulation of the regional (northwest Tasmanian) archaeological dataset. During this period, the high intensity occupation site experienced a peak in fire activity along with a marked reduction in the rate-of-change, reflecting a phase of low variability at a time of increased climatic variability and peak human population growth, while the low intensity occupation site maintained the positive relationship between fire activity, and climatic and environmental variability experienced by both sites at other times. We contend that increased human occupation intensity between ca. 1700 to 900 cal yr BP led to an increased intensity of land management and a resultant decrease in environmental variability as people actively managed the landscape to create a stable and predictable environment.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Rose:2004holocene,"This study investigates the role that climate and human intervention, have on local and regional fire regimes on the East Coast of the South Island, New Zealand during the second half of the Holocene. Continuous sampling of peat cores, from Travis Swamp, Halls Bush, Glendhu and Pomahaka, at one centimetre intervals allowed the detection of temporal and spatial differences in charcoal abundance. A set of nested sieves, with a mesh sizes of 250 μm, 125 μm and 63 μm, a digital camera, and image analysis software were successfully used to indicate charcoal abundance. Fire regimes prior to human arrival were controlled by fuel moisture levels and restricted by climatic influences on the lack of a suitable ignition source, resulting in significantly higher levels of fire activity in the Otago region compared with Canterbury. Regional fire activities changed over time due to changes in precipitation or evaporative rates. Polynesian exploration of the South island on arrival was rapid, resulting in a sudden increase in the frequency of fire simultaneously throughout the East Coast, approximately 700 years b.p. Deforestation in the Otago region was rapid and complete, due to low moisture levels, compared with a slower more gradual process of forest loss at the Canterbury sites. European settlement resulted in intensive burning associated with to farming practices, throughout the East coast. This change in fire regime resulted in the further deforestation of forest in the Canterbury region. After deforestation had occurred, fire became restricted due to lack of sufficient fuel continuity in the drier areas. Critique of the methodology indicates the most suitable of sieves to utilise in future studies is the one with the 250 μm mesh size.

Rosendahl:2012thesis,"Defining and understanding change as observed in the mid-to-late Holocene Australian archaeological record is the primary focus of this research. For this thesis I conducted a detailed local archaeological survey of a mid-to-late Holocene landscape to examine aspects of continuity and change in the coastal environments of the Sandalwood River in the Yiinkan Embayment, Mornington Island, southeast Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Focus is given to the theoretical and methodological problems emerging in coastal and island archaeology such as the importance of constructing reliable chronologies, interpreting the archaeological data in the context of local landscape and environmental development, and assessing the integrity of open tropical archaeological coastal sites. The Yiinkan Embayment is an ideal region to address these issues as it contains datasets that enable the development of refined local chronologies of land formation processes and palaeoenvironmental conditions. These datasets included numerous fixed biological indicators in the form of black-lipped oyster (Striostrea mytiloides) bioherms that are used to construct local sea-level models and infer palaeoenvironmental conditions. In addition, a series of transgressive parallel beach ridges, that have a deposition chronology mirroring that documented on the adjacent mainland, have been used to reconstruct palaeocoastlines and further refine the timing of local mid-to-late Holocene landform evolution. Extensive archaeological surveys were taken across c.27km2 at the Sandalwood River catchment. The study area was stratified into six survey zones based on broad geomorphological characteristics (e.g. stranded beach ridge of saltpan). Surveys recorded 164 cultural sites and 12 natural bioherms. Results of the survey and excavation of three shell mounds are presented. Differences in site structure, composition and chronology are interpreted to present a temporal and spatial pattern of variability in the use of a range of local environmental zones throughout the late Holocene. ...

The reserve, now under the control of Davidson Park Trust, had been closed to public access for 60 years while it was used as a naval explosives depot. The Society believed that this closure to public use would have assisted the preservation of Aboriginal relics in the area, and felt that an archaeological survey should be undertaken in 1975 to determine the nature and extent of such relics before they suffered damage by exposure to public use.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Occupation then was restricted to the northern part of the Mallee; more widespread occupation did not occur until long after the favourable conditions of the Holocene ended.

Aboriginal people recall fishing as a major subsistence activity, yet archaeological evidence of low rates of fish bone discard have questioned this memory. In an effort to address these contrasting perceptions, excavation of the Lazaret Midden on Peel Island employed a 1 mm mesh sieve to maximize fish bone recovery. Our results suggest that fish remains are indeed numerous in this site, although the extreme fragmentation of the bone recovered from the fine sieve makes identification of fish taxa largely impossible.

Rossi:2010mulka,"Mulka‘s Cave is a profusely decorated hollow boulder at The Humps, a large granite dome near Hyden, a small town 350 km southeast of Perth. The importance of the artwork has been recognised for 50 years. Test excavations in the cave in 1988 yielded 210 mainly quartz artefacts assignable to the Australian Small Tool phase and a radiocarbon date of 420 ± 50 BP from just below the lowest artefact found. The artwork was recorded in detail in 2004. The recorder considered the radiocarbon date to be ‘anomalously young‘ because most of the artwork is in poor condition, suggesting that it was made 3000-2000 years ago. Other dated rock art sites in Southwestern Australia came into use 4000-3000 BP. The excavators argued that the site was fairly insignificant, while the rock art researcher thought the profusion of motifs (452) made it a site of some significance, particularly in Southwestern Australia. The main aim of this study was to investigate these conflicting claims by re-investigating how Mulka‘s Cave had been used by Aboriginal people in the archaeological past. This research became possible because local tourist organisations obtained federal funding to install an elevated walkway outside the cave in 2006. Under Section 18 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act (1972) 12 of the 34 postholes required were excavated and artefacts were collected from all the ground surfaces to be impacted. Subsequently, under Section 16 of the AHA, four, small, 0.5 x 0.5 m, testpits were excavated around the site: outside the cave entrance, on The Humps and in the Camping Area; a sheltered spot where the Traditional Owners had camped as children, with their grandparents. Organic material was scarce, so analysis focused on the numbers and types of stone artefacts recovered. The artefacts excavated in 1988 were also re-analysed. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained, which suggested that people began visiting the Camping Area (and using ochre) about 6500 BP, making Mulka‘s Cave one of the oldest radiometrically dated rock art sites in southern Western Australia. The artefact data from Mulka‘s Cave were compared to those from these sites. The low artefact discard rate and high proportion of retouched/formal tools found at Mulka‘s Cave may indicate that the site was used differently from the other sites, but the data are problematic. ...

Rossi:2017baja,"Topography is expected to record tectonic, climatic, and rock strength controls on long-term denudation rates in active margins. We test this hypothesis in the Sierra San Pedro Mártir, Mexico—the footwall of the normal-faulted, western margin of the Gulf of California rift system—by relating topographic metrics with 10Be-derived catchment-averaged denudation rates. Denudation rates and topographic metrics record along-strike gradients in rock uplift relative to base level that increase asymmetrically from fault tips to maxima within the northern half of the range. Surface uplift of an Eocene erosional surface and slope-break knickpoints found at increasingly higher elevations in the northern segments of the Sierra San Pedro Mártir fault system suggest that range asymmetry is due to a recent northward acceleration in the rate of rock uplift relative to base level. By characterizing the relationship between channel steepness and cosmogenic denudation rates, we extrapolate millennial-scale denudation rates to million-year time scales and estimate ages for the transient increase in rock uplift rates and the initial onset of normal faulting.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Rowe:2006landscapes,"In his magnum opus, Continent of hunter-gatherers, Harry Lourandos (1997, p.334) concluded: Given the structural similarities between many New Guinean hunterhorticultural and Australia[n] hunter-gatherer economies . . . together with the Australian archaeological data of the Holocene, it may be argued that both regions appear to have experienced an economic expansion or intensification in the late Holocene, and in particular in the last 2,000--1,000 years or so. In general, the two prehistories are also connected at least in the Torres Strait region and north Australia. The recent (late Holocene), more intensive use of offshore islands (and their marine and terrestrial foods) is common to both southern New Guinea and northern Australian regions. What Lourandos alludes to here is not only that similar late-Holocene socioeconomic trajectories are evident in these two regions, but more critically that the perceived dichotomy between, on the one hand, 'hunter-gatherer' Australia and, on the other, 'horticultural' New Guinea — each occupying an opposite side of Torres Strait — fades in the geographical and conceptual link that is 'the Strait' (see David & Denham, this volume). When drawing historical links between the two regions, then, Lourandos (1997) was not only writing of contemporaneity in the timing of cultural change — temporal trends in economic production and social practice on both sides of the Strait, for example — but also of changing relationships people had with their surroundings. Thus, Lourandos presents an archaeology of cultural landscapes — not of so-called 'natural' environments, but a history of the way people engaged with their surroundings, and a history that has commonalities across northern Australia, Torres Strait and into New Guinea.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Data demonstrate a late-Holocene mangrove to mudflat transition, with vegetation patterns largely a function of low sediment loading, sedimentary redistributions and salinisation upon sea level decline c. 2000 cal. yr BP. These trends appear unique to Caution Bay, highlighting a variety of Holocene shoreline vegetation changes along the PNG south coast, each dependent on geomorphologic setting and hydrological fluxes.

This island swamp development is important in supporting vegetation differentiated from eucalypt woodland growth. The swamps also constitute an important dry season resource and refugia. Eucalypt-dominated woodland is evident throughout the records, but is increasingly influenced by fire (in structure and composition).

Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5-meter sediment core provides a record of vegetation change, fire history and climate spanning 12,700 cal BP to the present day. This study focusses on tree-grass vegetation dynamics, eucalypt to non-eucalypt plant interactions, and climate--fire--human relationships in an area where few long-term savanna records exist. The dataset suggests wetlands experienced alternating episodes of ephemeral waterlogging and seasonal inundation due to post-glacial monsoon variability up until permanent inundation from approximately 6000 cal BP. The surrounding catchment transformed from a terminal Pleistocene--early Holocene wooded-savanna to a later Holocene open forest. This increase in woody cover was a prominent site feature, primarily driven by climate--moisture availability. In turn, the extent of fire and fire impact, is a function of climate--vegetation feedbacks. Such interplay between fire history, climate change and vegetation pattern was also influenced by more intense human management of the area, in the last 4000 years of the record. It is proposed Girraween may have become a much-socialized and managed human landscape in this late Holocene phase. Results provide essential baseline data describing savanna dynamics linked to contemporary ecological observation, understanding and management goals, and serves as an important resource for the Quaternary sciences and archeology of northern Australia.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Rowe:2020carpenters,"Carpenter's Gap 1 is a large rockshelter located within the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia. The site provides valuable archives of late Quaternary palaeoecological information within an area known for a lack of deposits preserving long-term continuous botanical records. Previous studies of the macrobotanic, phytolith and wood charcoal records from Carpenter's Gap 1 are in general agreement about changes in broad vegetation patterns over time but differ in the time scales used, in the representation of some species, and in the interpretation of changes -- particularly on the degree to which the variations in the record represent cultural activities. An examination of palynology (the transport, deposition and preservation of pollen within the rockshelter environment) provides more detail to the vegetation patterns identified in these previous studies. In addition, because the pollen most likely reflects the vegetation of the site's surrounds over time rather than plants introduced into the shelter by people, interpretation can be more confidently linked to environmental change, and by inference climatic conditions. The pollen data reveal pre-glacial mixed wooded vegetation. From the beginning of the Holocene, tree loss occurred in a transition from monsoonal forest to thicket and eucalypt forest to woodland. Vegetation transition around the mid Holocene suggests a shift in climate, becoming drier and more variable towards and into the late Holocene.

Rowe:2020girraween,"Northern Australia is a region where limited information exists on environments at the last glacial maximum (LGM). Girraween Lagoon is located on the central northern coast of Australia and is a site representative of regional tropical savanna woodlands. Girraween Lagoon remained a perennial waterbody throughout the LGM, and as a result retains a complete proxy record of last-glacial climate, vegetation and fire. This study combines independent palynological and geochemical analyses to demonstrate a dramatic reduction in both tree cover and woody richness, and an expansion of grassland, relative to current vegetation at the site. The process of tree decline was primarily controlled by the cool-dry glacial climate and CO2 effects, though more localised site characteristics restricted wetland-associated vegetation. Fire processes played less of a role in determining vegetation than during the Holocene and modern day, with reduced fire activity consistent with significantly lower biomass available to burn. Girraween Lagoon's unique and detailed palaeoecological record provides the opportunity to explore and assess modelling studies of vegetation distribution during the LGM, particularly where a number of different global vegetation and/or climate simulations are inconsistent for northern Australia, and at a range of resolutions.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

This paper examines palaeoecological and archaeological data from a lowland open savanna site situated on the south-central PNG coastline. The methods used incorporate pollen and micro-charcoal analyses, artefact recovery and sediment descriptions. We conclude with an environmental model of sedimentation and vegetation change for the past c. 5,800 years, revealing a mid to late Holocene savanna interchange between herbaceous and woody plant growth, with fluctuating fire occurrence increasing toward the present day. Increased silt deposition and modified regional hydrology are also recorded. Environmental changes correspond in timing with the start of permanent settlements and human use of fire.

Rowe:2022marura,"Aims: Informed management of savanna systems depends on understanding determinates of composition, structure and function, particularly in relation to woody-plant components. This understanding needs to be regionally based, both past and present. In this study, Holocene plant patterns are explored at a site within the eucalypt savannas of northern Australia. Australian savannas are the least developed globally and uniquely placed to track ecological change. Location: Northern Territory, Australia. Methods: Palynological analyses were undertaken on a 5-m sediment core, spanning the last 10,700 calendar years. Pollen was categorised to capture vegetation type, classified further according to plant function and/or environmental response. Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used to quantify ecological dissimilarities through time. Results: At the Pleistocene transition, grasses were abundant then declined and remained low relative to increased woody cover from the mid-late Holocene. Savanna composition gradually transitioned from Corymbia to Eucalyptus dominance until significantly disturbed by a phase of repeated, extreme climate events. Highest non-savanna variability in terrestrial and wetland plant types formed mixed vegetation communities through the mid-Holocene. Conclusions: Savannas are not homogeneous but the product of plant changes in multiple dimensions. In the Northern Territory, dynamic though restricted non-eucalypt shifts are embedded within larger, slower eucalypt change processes. Primary climate--vegetation relationships determine the long-term fire regime. The role of large but infrequent disturbance events in maintaining savanna diversity are significant, in degrees of impact on tree--grass turnover, its form and the extent of vegetation recovery.

An inspection of Admiralty charts for the area also revealed that the 15 m water-depth contour is only 300 m offshore from Stockyard Point.

At Byfield there is a turn-off to the Farnborough-Byfield Road and from here it is about 25 km to Stockyard Point.

Spatial and temporal variations in the transport rate of potential pollutants such as sediments results in landscape modification through either erosion or deposition of material. Through the study of the timing, rate and nature of both erosion and deposition, inferences can be drawn about the state of the catchment, its sediment sources and their sinks, which in turn can be used to help develop management strategies to improve water quality. This study presents a comparison of pre- and post-European settlement alluvial deposition patterns along the principal rivers of the Lake Burragorang catchment. The study is one component of a multi-disciplinary collaborative research project between CSIRO Land and Water and the Sydney Catchment Authority and provides a field-based assessment of the temporal changes in sediment movement within the catchment which can be used to constrain a number of hydrologic and sediment transport-related parameters in the modelling component of the project. Four study sites on the Wollondilly, Cox's and Mulwaree Rivers were selected for detailed study, with each site representing a distinct physiographic environment in the catchment. Optical dating techniques have been applied to establish the timing and rate of major phases of deposition and storage of fluvial sediments. ...

Rustomji:2007recovery,"Increased catchment sediment yields are common following the introduction of European-style agriculture to relatively undisturbed landscapes. Catchment erosion rates generally increase immediately after disturbance and then decline over time. Consequently, where a catchment currently sits along this disturbance-recovery sequence will strongly influence future catchment sediment yields and river morphology. In this study, field stratigraphy, optical dating, and hydraulic modelling are used to investigate changes in catchment sediment yield and storage in the Lake Burragorang catchment in Australia with emphasis placed upon changes occurring since European settlement in A.D. 1820. On the Southern Tablelands and the upper Cox's River subcatchment, a large volume of sediment was liberated by gully erosion early in the post-settlement period, much of which was deposited at break of slope positions below the catchment's headwaters or stored in alluvial benches adjacent to the channel but within the confines of older Holocene alluvium. A lack of substantial sediment deposition over the last 20 to 40~years is evidence that catchment sediment yields have strongly declined. This is consistent with both reduced erosion rates and re-aggradation of the incised gullies that, in their erosive phase, dominated the catchment's post-settlement sediment flux. Collectively, these characteristics indicate the catchment is undergoing a phase of landscape recovery.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Two measuring methods of concentration were used: (i) in situ produced 10Be in quartz veins (surface erosion rates) and (ii) 10Be in fluvial sediments (basin erosion rates). The results confirm that (i) erosion tends to be more aggressive close to the headwaters than in the lower parts of the basin and (ii) the region is now affected by dissection.

Salgado:2014escarpment,"The Serra do Mar escarpment, located along the southeastern coast of Brazil, is a high-elevation passive margin escarpment. This escarpment evolved from the denudation of granites, migmatites and gneisses. The granites outcrop in the form of a ridge along the escarpment crest, due to its differential erosion ('sugarloaf' hills) from the surrounding lithologies. Several studies suggest that the passive margin escarpments are actively retreating toward the interior of the continent. However, no prior study has calculated the long-term denudation rates of Serra do Mar to test this hypothesis. In this study, we measured the in situ-produced 10Be concentration in fluvial sediments to quantify the catchment-wide long-term denudation rates of the Serra do Mar escarpment in southern Brazil. We sampled the fluvial sediments from ten watersheds that drain both sides of the escarpment. The average long-term denudation rate of the oceanic side is between 2.1- and 2.6-fold higher than the rate of the continental side: 26.04±1.88 mm ka-1 (integrating over between 15.8 ka-1 and 46.6 ka-1) and 11.10±0.37 mm ka-1 (integrating over between 52.9 ka-1 and 85.4 ka-1), respectively. These rates indicate that the coastal base level is controlling the escarpment retreat toward the continental high lands, which is consistent with observations made at other high-elevation passive margins around the globe. The results also demonstrate the differential erosion along the Serra do Mar escarpment in southern Brazil during the Quaternary, where drainages over granites had lower average denudation rates in comparison with those over migmatites and gneisses. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the ocean-facing catchments have been eroded more intensely than those facing the continent. The results also reveal that drainage over the granites decreases the average denudation rates of the ocean-facing catchments and the 'sugarloaf' hills therefore are natural barriers that slowly retreat once they are exhumed.

Salgado:2016relief,"This study aims to quantify the denudation dynamics of the Brazilian passive margin along a segment of the Continental Rift of Southeast Brazil. The denudation rates of 30 basins that drain both horsts of the continental rift, including the mountain ranges of the Serra do Mar (seaside horst); and the Serra da Mantiqueira (continental horst); were derived from 10Be concentrations measured in sand-sized river sediment. The mean denudation rate ranges from 9.2 m Ma−1 on the plateau of the Serra do Mar to 37.1 m Ma−1 along the oceanic escarpment of the Serra do Mar. The seaward-facing scarps of both mountain ranges exhibit mean denudation rates that are approximately 1.5 times those of the inland-facing scarps. The escarpments of the horst nearer to the ocean (Serra do Mar) exhibit higher denudation rates (mean 30.2 m Ma−1) than the escarpments of the continental horst (Serra da Mantiqueira) (mean 16.5 m Ma−1). The parameters that impact these denudation rates include the catchment relief, the slope gradient, the rock and the climate. The incongruent combination of a mountainous landscape and moderate to low 10Be-based denudation rates averaging at ∼20 m Ma−1 suggests a reduction in intraplate tectonic activity beginning in the Middle Quaternary or earlier.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Santos:2012biomarker,"Reconstructions of primary productivity at lowlatitudes have been the focus of several studies to better understand how the export of nutrient-rich, intermediate Southern Ocean (SO) waters influences productivity at these latitudes. This was triggered by the general observation of minima in the planktonic foraminiferal δ13C values during deglaciations, which was interpreted as an isotopic signal of intermediate SO waters, together with a concomitant increase in diatom productivity at some equatorial sites. However, the impact of these SO waters on productivity at higher latitudes is not well constrained. Here, we compare a high-resolution planktonic foraminiferal δ13C record with total organic carbon and biomarker records for Proboscia diatoms and haptophytes in marine sediments from offshore Southeastern Australia. The planktonic foraminiferal δ13C record shows distinct minima during deglaciations and the Marine Isotope Stage 4/3 transition, tentatively suggesting that 13C-depleted SO waters reached the coast of Southeastern Australia. However, it did not result in increased productivity during these periods. Instead, the highest primary productivity period, as indicated by total organic carbon and alkenone accumulation rates, occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum while Proboscia diatoms mainly proliferated during interglacials and Marine Isotope Stage 3 matching periods of increased diatom productivity in some sites of the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. Our study suggests that increased primary productivity offshore Southeastern Australia was mainly due to stronger westerly winds during glacial periods while Proboscia diatom productivity was probably controlled by the transport of silicic acid to this area.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Savi:2014zielbach,"Basin-wide erosion rates can be determined through the analysis of in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides. In transient landscapes, and particularly in mountain catchments, erosion and transport processes are often highly variable and consequently the calculated erosion rates can be biased. This can be due to sediment pulses and poor mixing of sediment in the stream channels. The mixing of alluvial sediment is one of the principle conditions that need to be verified in order to have reliable results. In this paper we perform a field-based test of the extent of sediment mixing for a ∼42 km2 catchment in the Alps using concentrations of river-born 10Be. We use this technique to assess the mechanisms and the spatio-temporal scales for the mixing of sediment derived from hillslopes and tributary channels. ...

Savi:2016argentina,"In the Central Andes, several studies on alluvial terraces and valley fills have linked sediment aggradation to periods of enhanced sediment supply. However, debate continues over whether tectonic or climatic factors are most important in triggering the enhanced supply. The Del Medio catchment in the Humahuaca Basin (Eastern Cordillera, NW Argentina) is located within a transition zone between subhumid and arid climates and hosts the only active debris‐flow fan within this intermontane valley. By combining 10Be analyses of boulder and sediment samples within the Del Medio catchment, with regional morphometric measurements of nearby catchments, we identify the surface processes responsible for aggradation in the Del Medio fan and their likely triggers. We find that the fan surface has been shaped by debris flows and channel avulsions during the last 400 years. Among potential tectonic, climatic, and autogenic factors that might influence deposition, our analyses point to a combination of several favorable factors that drive aggradation. These are in particular the impact of occasional abundant rainfall on steep slopes in rock types prone to failure, located in a region characterized by relatively low rainfall amounts and limited transport capacity. These characteristics are primarily associated with the climatic transition zone between the humid foreland and the arid orogen interior, which creates an imbalance between sediment supply and sediment transfer. The conditions and processes that drive aggradation in the Del Medio catchment today may provide a modern analog for the conditions and processes that drove aggradation in other nearby tributaries in the past.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Schaller:2001european,"We have calculated long-term erosion rates of 20–100 mm/kyr from quartz-contained 10Be in the bedload of middle European rivers for catchments ranging from 102 to 105 km2. These rates average over 10–40 kyr and agree broadly with rock uplift, incision and exhumation rates, historic soil erosion rates, and erosion rates calculated from the measured sediment loads of the same rivers. Moreover, our new erosion rate estimates correlate well with lithology and relief. However, in the Regen, Neckar, Loire, and Meuse catchments, cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rates are consistently 1.5–4 times greater than the equivalent rates derived from measured river loads. This may be due to the systematic under-representation of high-magnitude, low-frequency transport events in the gauging records which cover less than a century. Alternatively the discrepancy may derive from spatially non-uniform erosion and preferential tapping of deeper sections of the irradiation profile. A third explanation relates the high cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rates to inheritance of an elevated Pleistocene erosion signal. Uncertainties associated with the cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rate estimates are not greater than the potential errors in conventional estimates. Therefore, the cosmogenic nuclide approach is an effective tool for rapid, catchment-wide assessment of time-integrated rates of bedrock weathering and erosion, and we anticipate its fruitful application to the Quaternary sedimentary record.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Schaller:2016european,"The denudation of landscapes is affected by temporal and spatial variations in tectonics, climate, and vegetation. However, deciphering the contributions of these different processes has proven challenging. In this study, cosmogenic nuclide-derived modern and paleo catchment-wide denudation rates in four European rivers are investigated. We present 12 new and 4 recalculated cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates from modern river sediments and 14 paleo-denudation rates from terraces deposited over the last 2 Ma. The catchments studied are located in regions with minimal Quaternary tectonic activity and span different climates over 12o latitude. Results indicate that modern denudation rates range between 16 ± 11 and 51 ± 7 mm/ka with no clear latitudinal variation. Modern denudation rates are compared with catchment geomorphic indices including slope, fluvial steepness index, and relief. The denudation rates correlate better to catchment topographic indices (R2 ≈ 0.4) rather than climate. Paleo-denudation rates range from 8 ± 7 to 56 ± 7 mm/ka and are associated with a possible increase in the average paleo-denudation rates over the past 2 Ma. Taken together, the results indicate that quantification of catchment-wide denudation rates over long (Quaternary) time scales because of climate change is difficult. Future work to study climate influence on denudation rates should focus on the successes of previous work that document transient denudation rates over shorter and more recent time scales, i.e., from the Last Glacial Maximum to present.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Scharf:2013strong,"The Cape Mountains of southern Africa exhibit an alpine-like topography in conjunction with some of the lowest denudation rates in the world. This presents an exception to the often-cited coupling of topography and denudation rates and suggests that steep slopes alone are not sufficient to incite the high denudation rates with which they are commonly associated. Within the Cape Mountains, slope angles are often in excess of 30° and relief frequently exceeds 1 km, yet 10Be-based catchment-averaged denudation rates vary between 2.32 ± 0.29 m/m.y. and 7.95 ± 0.90 m/m.y. We attribute the maintenance of rugged topography and suppression of denudation rates primarily to the presence of physically robust and chemically inert quartzites that constitute the backbone of the mountains. 10Be-based bedrock denudation rates on the interfluves of the mountains vary between 1.98 ± 0.23 m/m.y. and 4.61 ± 0.53 m/m.y. The close agreement between the rates of catchment-averaged and interfluve denudation indicates topography in steady state. These low denudation rates, in conjunction with the suggestion of geomorphic stability, are in agreement with the low denudation rates (<20 m/m.y.) estimated for southern Africa during the late Cenozoic by means of cosmogenic nuclide, thermochronology, and offshore sedimentation analyses. Accumulatively, these data suggest that the coastal hinterland of the subcontinent may have experienced relative tectonic stability throughout the Cenozoic.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

According to the cladistic analysis and previous propositions, it is possible to infer that two Camelidae migration events occurred in America. In the first one, Hemiauchenia arrived in South America and, this was related to the speciation processes that originated Lama and Vicugna. In the second event, Palaeolama migrated from North America to the northern portion of South America.

Scherler:2013garhwal,"Erosion in the Himalaya is responsible for one of the greatest mass redistributions on Earth and has fueled models of feedback loops between climate and tectonics. Although the general trends of erosion across the Himalaya are reasonably well known, the relative importance of factors controlling erosion is less well constrained. Here we present 25 10Be‐derived catchment‐averaged erosion rates from the Yamuna catchment in the Garhwal Himalaya, northern India. Tributary erosion rates range between ~0.1 and 0.5 mm yr−1 in the Lesser Himalaya and ~1 and 2 mm yr−1 in the High Himalaya, despite uniform hillslope angles. The erosion‐rate data correlate with catchment‐averaged values of 5 km radius relief, channel steepness indices, and specific stream power but to varying degrees of nonlinearity. Similar nonlinear relationships and coefficients of determination suggest that topographic steepness is the major control on the spatial variability of erosion and that twofold to threefold differences in annual runoff are of minor importance in this area. Instead, the spatial distribution of erosion in the study area is consistent with a tectonic model in which the rock uplift pattern is largely controlled by the shortening rate and the geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault (MHT). Our data support a shallow dip of the MHT underneath the Lesser Himalaya, followed by a midcrustal ramp underneath the High Himalaya, as indicated by geophysical data. Finally, analysis of sample results from larger main stem rivers indicates significant variability of 10Be‐derived erosion rates, possibly related to nonproportional sediment supply from different tributaries and incomplete mixing in main stem channels.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Schildgen:2016argentina,"Fluvial fill terraces preserve sedimentary archives of landscape responses to climate change, typically over millennial timescales. In the Humahuaca Basin of NW Argentina (Eastern Cordillera, southern Central Andes), our 29 new optically stimulated luminescence ages of late Pleistocene fill terrace sediments demonstrate that the timing of past river aggradation occurred over different intervals on the western and eastern sides of the valley, despite their similar bedrock lithology, mean slopes, and precipitation. In the west, aggradation coincided with periods of increasing precipitation, while in the east, aggradation coincided with decreasing precipitation or more variable conditions. Erosion rates and grain size dependencies in our cosmogenic 10Be analyses of modern and fill terrace sediments reveal an increased importance of landsliding compared to today on the west side during aggradation, but of similar importance during aggradation on the east side. Differences in the timing of aggradation and the 10Be data likely result from differences in valley geometry, which causes sediment to be temporarily stored in perched basins on the east side. It appears as if periods of increasing precipitation triggered landslides throughout the region, which induced aggradation in the west, but blockage of the narrow bedrock gorges downstream from the perched basins in the east. As such, basin geometry and fluvial connectivity appear to strongly influence the timing of sediment movement through the system. For larger basins that integrate subbasins with differing geometries or degrees of connectivity (like Humahuaca), sedimentary responses to climate forcing are likely attenuated.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The mountain range has been subjected to steep rock trajectories and pronounced orographic rainfall for the last several million years, presenting an ideal setting for using low-temperature thermochronometric data to explore its topographic evolution. We perform three-dimensional thermal-kinematic modeling of previously published thermochronometric data spanning the windward and leeward sides of the range to explore the most likely structural and topographic evolution of the range. We find that the data can be explained by scenarios involving drainage-divide migration alone, or by scenarios that also involve changes in the structures that have accommodated deformation through time. ...

Schmidt:2016yunnan,"In order to understand better if and where erosion rates calculated using in situ 10Be are affected by contemporary changes in land use and attendant deep regolith erosion, we calculated erosion rates using measurements of in situ 10Be in quartz from 52 samples of river sediment collected from three tributaries of the Mekong River (median basin area = 46.5 km2). Erosion rates range from 12 to 209 mm kyr−1 with an area-weighted mean of 117 ± 49 mm kyr−1 (1 standard deviation) and median of 74 mm kyr−1. We observed a decrease in the relative influence of human activity from our steepest and least altered watershed in the north to the most heavily altered landscapes in the south. In the areas of the landscape least disturbed by humans, erosion rates correlate best with measures of topographic steepness. In the most heavily altered landscapes, measures of modern land use correlate with 10Be-estimated erosion rates but topographic steepness parameters cease to correlate with erosion rates. We conclude that, in some small watersheds with high rates and intensity of agricultural land use that we sampled, tillage and resultant erosion has excavated deeply enough into the regolith to deliver subsurface sediment to streams and thus raise apparent in situ 10Be-derived erosion rates by as much as 2.5 times over background rates had the watersheds not been disturbed.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Using in situ 10Be in detrital river sediments, we measured sediment generation rates for tributaries to the lower Jinsha River. We find that the ratio of modern sediment yield to long-term sediment generation rate is 5.9 ± 2.8 (mean, 1 SD, n = 5), which is significantly higher than that elsewhere in western China and implies contemporary rates of sediment export far exceed long-term rates of sediment generation by weathering on hillslopes (1.9 ± 1.6 [median, 1 SD, n = 20]; [Schmidt et al., 2017]).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Schrire:2014arnhem,"As far as recorded cultural history extends man's thinking, man has been born into existing explanatory systems. A distinguishing aspect of many of these discussions from the point of view of anyone familiar with the history of ideas is the extreme theoretical myopia of the discussions. Anthropologists and archaeologists have typically acted as if the 'problem' concerning explanation and knowing that have been discussed in the history of ideas were of no consequence to their own so-called 'explanations'. Much of the staggering confusion in present debates as to the value of scientific analysis in social science can only be understood in terms of the majority of the discussants thinking that they understand scientific analysis after reading a few discussions of science. Scientific analysis may be conceptualized as an attempt by some men to go beyond the voices of mere 'authority' to explanatory systems that are coordinated with observation and experience as to be open to others for examination.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,

Scott:2003wonderkrater,"Spring accumulations are valuable and rare sources for Quaternary pollen analysis and palaeoenvironmental research in South Africa. It is important to optimize their dating, which is sometimes complicated by root contamination. Thirteen new radiocarbon dates are presented from one of the most significant spring pollen sequences on which South African vegetation history is based, namely, from Wonderkrater in the Savanna Biome. Some anomalous measurements were recorded but a new chronology is proposed by excluding samples that were possibly contaminated by younger or older materials. The dating places the pollen-based vegetation history more firmly in a framework of regional and global climate change during the Late Quaternary, thereby making the information more suitable for comparison with other sequences and as vegetation data in global-change modelling.",2022-10-04 19:48:14.479 +0200,
Seagren:2020andes,"Understanding how tectonics, climate and lithology interact to control fluvial erosion is complicated because these factors are spatially-variable and they may not be well-represented by mean values. We address these complications using eight new and 54 published 10Be catchment-wide fluvial erosion rates from the south-central Andes. We assess how tectonics, climate, lithology, and topography control erosion through bivariate and multivariate Bayesian regression analysis. We first compare catchment-wide mean values of independent variables compared to other summary statistics and find that metrics that capture extreme values (e.g., 90th percentile) and spatial variability (e.g., 90th minus 10th percentile) produce stronger correlations. This suggests that catchment-wide means may oversimplify the roles of tectonics, climate, and lithology in influencing erosion rates. We find that the overall variability of erosion rates in the south-central Andes is best explained by a combination of lithologic resistance and spatial variability in both vegetation (using the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and topography (using specific stream power). Despite poor bivariate correlations, both lithologic resistance and spatial variability of specific stream power are significant regressors in our multivariate modeling. Lithology influences the relationship (i.e., linearity) between topography and erosion rates. Spatial variability of NDVI produces the strongest correlation with erosion rates of any of the variables we consider. Hence, spatial variability of NDVI both accounts for potential non-uniform vegetation responses to climate and also incorporates the role of both humid climates (high 90th percentile) and large bare regions (low 10th percentile) within a single catchment.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The Dora Baltea catchment (western Italian Alps) is an ideal setting for such investigation, since its large drainage system, extending from the Mont Blanc Massif to the Po Plain, cuts across different major lithotectonic units of the western Alps, whereas this region has experienced relatively homogeneous climatic conditions and glacial history throughout the Quaternary. We acquired new 10Be-derived catchment-wide denudation rates from 18 river-sand samples collected both along the main Dora Baltea river and at the outlet of its main tributaries.

Shaw:2015thesis,"The research presented in this thesis is focused on the archaeology of Rossel Island, the easternmost island in the Milne Bay Province, otherwise known culturally as the Massim. Rossel Island is one of the larger islands in the Louisiade Archipelago, and situated 400km from the mainland it is also one of the most isolated islands in the region. The people on the island today speak a Non-Austronesian language that is unrelated to the Austronesian languages spoken elsewhere in the Massim. The complexities of their cultural traditions are also regionally unparalleled and the people themselves are genetically distinct. Rossel Island is therefore seen as a unique outlier in the Massim region. The major aims of the archaeological project were twofold. First, to develop a chronology for human occupation on Rossel Island; and secondly, to identify spatial and temporal changes in the archaeological record that relate to the cultural development of this unique island population in prehistory. To place Rossel Island in a comparative regional framework, excavation was also undertaken on Nimowa Island in the Louisiade Archipelago, 80km to the west of Rossel. Nimowa and its people are physically and culturally different to Rossel. Eight of the sites excavated on Rossel, and one excavated on Nimowa are presented in this thesis. Excavation and radiocarbon dating indicates that people have been on Rossel Island since at least 2500-2350 BP. However, waisted stone blades found on the surface suggest that the island was colonised considerably earlier than this, probably during the Late Pleistocene when sea levels were lower and the island was much larger. ...

Shaw:2016pottery,"The introduction and exchange of pottery between Pacific Islands can provide insight into interaction and social organisation from both regional and local perspectives. In the Massim island region of far eastern Papua New Guinea, pottery is present in the archaeological record from 2800 to 2600 calBP. However, on Rossel Island, a relatively isolated landmass in the far east of the Louisiade Archipelago, archaeological excavation and AMS dating of several sites has determined that pottery on this island was a late prehistoric introduction, from 550–500 calBP. The introduction of pottery coincided with the establishment of increasingly complex exchange networks in the Massim, namely the Kula. It is argued in this paper that the desire for Kula participants to obtain high-quality shell necklaces (bagi), which are prominently manufactured on Rossel, led to the island becoming more actively involved in down-the-line regional exchange. Pottery is largely found on the western end of Rossel, where most bagi are manufactured. The uneven distribution of pottery across the island is further argued to indicate a socio-economic/political divide between the populations living on the western and eastern ends, which is supported by linguistic and anthropological evidence.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

This is the first excavation to be reported in detail from the archipelago, with the Malakai site providing insight into cultural practices on the island and pottery exchange in the southern Massim region. A stratified deposit was revealed with dense cultural material, first inhabited from 1350 to 1290 cal. BP, with a subsequent period of settlement within the last 460–300 cal. years. Pottery, shell, andstone artifactswere recovered, as well as human skeletal remains in a primary burial context, which contributes to understanding regional patterns of prehistoric mortuary activity. It is argued that Nimowa was already part of an exchange network that encompassed many of the southern Massim islands when the Malakai site was first occupied. There is increased diversity in the number of vessel forms in later prehistory, butwith remarkable continuity in the decorative motifs over time, suggesting some degree of regional social cohesion in the southern Massim. It appears that the northern Massim islands were not a major supplier of pottery to Nimowa.

Shaw:2020massim,"Islands present significant technological and ecological challenges for long-term human settlement, with archaeological investigations of islands globally able to shed light on the adaptive plasticity of cultural groups to changing climatic regimes. The Massim islands of eastern New Guinea significantly reduced in size throughout the Holocene (⩽11.7 kya), providing a unique opportunity to investigate the long-term adaptive capabilities of humans to changing island ecosystems. Here, we report a 2500-2300 year cultural sequence on Nimowa Island in the Louisiade Archipelago of the Massim region which began with the arrival of a late Lapita population during initial beachfront development. Sediment analyses indicate earlier settlement on the island would not have been possible as the coastline was unstable until near-modern sea levels were reached. The island was abandoned from 1290 to 530 cal. BP during a period of unusually dry conditions (‘Medieval Climate Anomaly‘) and probable freshwater shortages. Re-settlement coincided with wetter climatic conditions (‘Little Ice Age‘), associated with the establishment of large villages, the earliest expression of local pottery traditions and the onset of large-scale regional exchange networks. Import of non-local obsidian reflects two pulses of interaction followed by periods of increased isolation. With the absence of high-quality lithic resources, shell, coral and bone were used as a locally available alternative for tool production. Increased cyclone frequency from ~500 cal. BP greatly increased beach volume in the island and coastal New Guinea, which facilitated the movement of populations onto smaller islands.

Here, we report the earliest figurative stone carving and formally manufactured pestles in Oceania, dating to 5050 to 4200 years ago. These discoveries, at the highland site of Waim, occur with the earliest planilateral axe-adzes in New Guinea, the first evidence for fibercraft, and interisland obsidian transfer.

Shaw:2020smallest,"Late Pleistocene records of island settlement can shed light on how modern humans (Homo sapiens) adapted their behaviour to live on ecologically marginal landscapes. When people reached Sahul (Pleistocene New Guinea-Australia), between 65 and 50 ka, the only islands they would have encountered were in the tropical north. This unique geographic situation therefore offers the only possibility of modelling human adaptive behaviour to islands in Australasia during the Late Pleistocene. Cave excavation on the uplifted limestone island of Panaeati in the Massim region of Southeastern New Guinea revealed a cultural sequence commencing from 17,300-16,800 cal. BP, suggesting habitation of higher coastlines occurred as low-lying shorelines destabilised during the initial stages of deglacial sea-level rise. No cave use was evident between 12,400 and 4780 cal. BP when the continental shelf was fully inundated, and Panaeati reduced in size by 90 percent. It is likely that diminished coastlines and the reduced resources of low-lying islands could no longer support pre-agricultural populations during this time. Cultural groups that were better adapted to living on small islands returned to Panaeati by 4780-4490 cal. BP when sea levels had stabilised, lagoons formed, and coastal ecosystems had diversified. Investigations demonstrate the role of larger islands as refugia during deglacial sea-level rise and the effects on human dispersals and cultural diversity.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Shaw:2021cannibalism,"The consumption of human flesh, popularly defined as cannibalism, has arguably occurred throughout much of human history. In New Guinea, it has been associated ethnographically with warfare, mortuary rites and nutrition. However, it often evades detection in the archaeological record because of difficulties in distinguishing it from other social practices. Here we disentangle colonial myths associated with the consumption of human flesh and report disarticulated, burnt and cut human skeletal remains from two coastal sites spanning the past 540 years in the Massim island region of southeast Papua New Guinea. These sites, Wule and Morpa, both occur on Rossel Island. The skeletal evidence is contemporary with the construction of large stone platforms where human victims were often killed and consumed, and inland villages which were established in response to a well-attested period of conflict on Rossel and throughout the region. Within an ethnoarchaeological framework, we argue that cannibalism became increasingly prevalent in association with feasting as a means of maintaining social relationships and personal power.

Shaw:2022frontier,"The initial peopling of the remote Pacific islands was one of the greatest migrations in human history, beginning three millennia ago by Lapita cultural groups. The spread of Lapita out of an ancestral Asian homeland is a dominant narrative in the origins of Pacific peoples, and although Island New Guinea has long been recognized as a springboard for the peopling of Oceania, the role of Indigenous populations in this remarkable phase of exploration remains largely untested. Here, we report the earliest evidence for Lapita-introduced animals, turtle bone technology and repeated obsidian import in southern New Guinea 3,480-3,060 years ago, synchronous with the establishment of the earliest known Lapita settlements 700 km away. Our findings precede sustained Lapita migrations and pottery introductions by several centuries, occur alongside Indigenous technologies and suggest continued multicultural influences on population diversity despite language replacement. Our work shows that initial Lapita expansion throughout Island New Guinea was more expansive than previously considered, with Indigenous contact influencing migration pathways and island-hopping strategies that culminated in rapid and purposeful Pacific-wide settlement. Later Lapita dispersals through New Guinea were facilitated by earlier contact with Indigenous populations and profoundly influenced the region as a global centre of cultural and linguistic diversity.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Uncertainties associated with diagenetic environments of samples precluded reliable numerical age assignments for beds older than Holocene. Instead, relative dating of shell beds was based on a reference site (Goose Lagoon) which was assigned to the last interglacial based on its morphostratigraphic setting and concordant results of three of the dating methods (amino acid racemisation, uranium series disequilibrium and electron spin resonance). Overall there was considerable agreement between methods although not all were applied to each site. Uranium series dating proved most problematical.

Sherwood:2019moyjil,"An unusual shell deposit at Moyjil (Point Ritchie), Warrnambool, in western Victoria, has previously been dated at 67±10 ka and has features suggesting a human origin. If human, the site would be one of Australia's oldest, justifying a redetermination of age using amino acid racemisation (AAR) dating of Lunella undulata (syn. Turbo undulatus) opercula (the dominant shellfish present) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of the host calcarenite. AAR dating of the shell bed and four Last Interglacial (LIG) beach deposits at Moyjil and Goose Lagoon, 30 km to the west, confirmed a LIG age. OSL analysis of the host sand revealed a complex mixing history, with a significant fraction (47%) of grains giving an early LIG age (120-125 ka) using a three-component mixing model. Shell deposition following the LIG sea-level maximum at 120-125 ka is consistent with stratigraphic evidence. A sand layer immediately below the shell deposit gave an age of ~240 ka (i.e. MIS 7) and appears to have been a source of older sand incorporated into the shell deposit. Younger ages (~60-80 ka) are due to bioturbation before calcrete finally sealed the deposit. Uranium/thorium methods were not applicable to L. undulata opercula or an otolith of the fish Argyrosomus hololepidotus because they failed to act as closed systems. A U-Th age of 103 ka for a calcrete sheet within the 240 ka sand indicates a later period of carbonate deposition. Calcium carbonate dripstone from a LIG wave-cut notch gave a U-Th age of 11-14 ka suggesting sediment cover created a cave-like environment at the notch at this time. The three dating techniques have collectively built a chronology spanning the periods before and after deposition of the shell bed, which occurred just after the LIG sea-level maximum (120-125 ka).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Shi:2021wildfires,"Wildfires, or bushfires, are one of the most destructive natural disasters in Australia, which can cause many deaths of stock, native animals, sometimes humans, and huge impacts on infrastructure. Reconstructing past wildfires and exploring the links between wildfires and climate are essential for understanding the dynamics of wildfires and for predicting future risks. In this study, the frequency of wildfires in northeastern Australia over the past 25,000 years was reconstructed from the charcoal records preserved in peat and lake sediments. The results showed that the frequency of wildfires were relatively low during the cool last glacial period and the warm mid Holocene, indicating that the stable mean climate conditions, whether cool or warm, would not independently initiate increased wildfires in northeastern Australia. The most frequent wildfires occurred during the last deglaciation period, when Earth's climate warmed and the warming rate was the highest over the last 25,000 years, before recent anthropogenic warming. It suggested that the rapid global warming may greatly increase the likelihood of dangerous wildfires in northeastern Australia during the last deglaciation. The wildfires reactivated over the most recent 4000 years, coinciding with amplified climate variability and probably an expansion of human activity. The rapid warming of global climate during the last deglaciation period is an ideal analogue for current anthropogenic global warming. The comparison between fire count and temperature changes in Australia since 2003 also showed that the fire frequency in Australia in recent years is more closely correlated with the warming amplitude, rather than mean temperature. Our results implied that the wildfire risk in northeastern Australia may increase further under the expected accelerating global warming, if human management systems does not intrude. Wildfire modeling could benefit greatly by considering the relationship of fires with climate variability rather than only with stable climate scenarios.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

This short report summarises the results of archaeological excavations at the site, focusing on dated distributions of stone artefacts as the primary retrieved cultural material. The excavations revealed two main periods of occupation: the earlier from c. 1900 to 1300 cal. BP and the latter from c. 460-300 cal. BP to the proto-historic period.

Shiner:2013shell,"The Weipa shell mounds have a long history of archaeological research that has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the emergence of late Holocene coastal economies in northern Australia. However, much of this work has focused on broad comparisons of mounds between multiple locations rather than detailed studies of multiple mounds from single locations. This level of analysis is required to understand the record of both human occupation and environmental change and how these have given rise to the form of archaeological record visible in the present. In this paper we describe the results of a recent pilot study of four Anadara granosa-dominated shell mounds at Wathayn Outstation near Weipa in far north Queensland. We adopt a formational approach that investigates variability in shape, size, orientation, stratigraphy, shell fragmentation and diversity and mound chronology, as well as dating of the surfaces upon which the mounds have been constructed. Results indicate multiple periods of shell accumulation in each mound, separated by hiatuses. The mounds are the end product of a complex mix of processes that include how often and how intensively mounds were used and reused, together with the nature of the shell populations that people exploited and the post-depositional environmental changes that have occurred over the centuries the mounds have existed.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

Shulmeister:1992lowland,"A pollen record from a dunefield lake on Groote Eylandt, Northern Australia is presented. This is the first substantially complete Holocene terrestrial record from the seasonally humid lowland tropics of Northern Australia. The lake originated as a seasonal swamp prior to 10 000 BP. A progressive rise in water tables occurred until a permanent lake was established at about 9000 BP. From 9000 to 7500 BP the lake shows evidence of disruption in the surrounding dunefield. Prior to 7500 BP an open grassland covered the dunefield. After 7500 BP the area was rapidly colonized by Eucalyptus open forest and acacias. These types remain dominant to the present. The data suggest that conditions continuously ameliorated from the base of the record to the mid-Holocene and there is evidence of an effective precipitation maximum at about 4000 BP. Effective precipitation declined after 3800 BP but a recovery took place about 1000 BP.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,
Shulmeister:1995enso,"The Holocene climatic history of tropical northern Australia is re-examined using the recently published pollen record from Groote Eylandt to corroborate and refine previous climatic interpretations. We identify a four-stage Holocene comprising: (1) a continuous increase in effective precipitation (EP) from the beginning of the Holocene to about 5000 BP; (2) a mid-Holocene EP maximum from about 5000 to about 4000 BP; (3) a marked decline in EP somewhere between 4000-3500 Bp; and (4) an EP recovery in the last <2000 years. The mid-Holocene EP maximum is 1000 years later than Holocene EP maxima from temperate Southern Australia and suggests that the records are decoupled at this time. We focus on pollen evidence of environmental change at c. 4000 BP, which marks a break between a continuously ameliorating (increasing EP) climate but with small mean variation in the earlier Holocene and a steady (no directional trend) but highly variable later Holocene. We believe that this break represents the first evidence from the monsoonal lowlands of northern Australia for the onset of 'modern' ENSO-dominated ocean-atmosphere interactions in the Holocene. A simple conceptual model of trans-Pacific teleconnections is presented to explain this onset and as an hypothesis for testing.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Shulmeister:2003cobb,"Ten pollen records from the Cobb Valley and adjacent areas in North-West Nelson are described. Collectively they provide a vegetation record extending from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present day. During the Last Glacial Maximum the uplands of North-West Nelson were glaciated. By about 17 000 radiocarbon years BP ice had retreated some distance up the Cobb River valley and a podocarp heath and tussockland vegetation covered non-glaciated areas. By 14 000 radiocarbon years BP, the valley floor and adjacent lower ridges were occupied by montane podocarp forest dominated by Phyllocladus and Halocarpus. Beech forest expanded into some sites as early as 13 000 yr BP but the modern beech cover was not established until the Holocene.

The reconstructed atmospheric circulation is similar to the present-day conditions, and we infer no significant changes in circulation at those times, as compared to the present day.

Siame:2011taiwan,"The direct and feedback relationships between tectonics, climate and denudation are a matter of debate. A better understanding of these relationships requires quantifying rates of denudation in a wide range of climate and tectonic settings, as well as at various time and space scales. Because of an ongoing active collision implying high uplift rates and a climate prone to extreme rainfall events and frequent tropical typhoons facilitating strong erosion dominated by mass movements and high degree of fluvial transport, the Taiwan environment is highly dynamic. In this work, spatially-averaged denudation rates determined along the network of one of the major rivers in Taiwan (Lanyang River) from in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides (10Be) measured in river-borne quartz minerals are compared to the erosion rates determined from the statistical analysis of modern sediment load data. Integrated over the last several hundreds of years, the denudation rate derived from in situ-produced 10Be concentrations averages 2 ± 1 mm/yr within the Lanyang watershed. Integrated over the last 50 years, the erosion rate given by modern sediment load data is 5–7 mm/yr within the same catchment area. The studied catchment being characterized by a relatively low-level of human activity, the discrepancy between the two rates is most probably due different sensibilities to high-frequency, stochastic erosional events (typhoons and earthquakes). The cosmogenic-derived denudation rates can thus be regarded as more representatives for quantifying erosion processes on the short-time scale, and be strictly compared to the long-term exhumation rates derived from low-temperature chronological data.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Along the eastern and northern borders of the range, incision and uplift rates have been estimated at approximately 0.5 and 1 mm/yr when integrated on Holocene and Pleistocene time scales, in close agreement with both long‐term (structural and basin evolution data) and short‐term (GPS‐derived velocity field) analyses. Cosmogenic‐derived denudation and uplift rates combined with geomorphic characteristics of watersheds and river channels allows estimating the onset of the uplift at 4–6 Ma, followed by a more recent period of topographic rejuvenation at roughly 1–2 Ma, probably synchronous with steepening of the eastern and northern flanks of the anticline.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Sim:1998furneaux,"Early European explorers were puzzled by the absence of Aboriginal populations on the larger more remote larger islands of the Bass Strait as at least King and Flinders Islands appeared capable of supporting human populations. Subsequent discoveries of stone artefacts on several of the Bassian islands were variously ascribed to human occupation during the landbridge phase or historic times, when Aboriginal Tasmanians had been taken to the islands by sealers and by G.A. Robinson for resettlement However, the discovery of shell midden sites on Flinders Island in the 1970s brought new perspectives to the previous artefact finds - these prehistoric midden sites suggested people had been living on or visiting Flinders Island after the inundation of the Bassian landbridge. Radiocarbon dating of the midden sites on Flinders Island indicated that people were on Flinders Island until about 4,500 BP but absent in more recent times. The aim of the research was to investigate why it should be that evidence of human occupation on Flinders Island disappears from the archaeological record about 4,500 years ago, some 5,000 years of so after insulation. The primary step in this investigation was to determine whether the habitation ceased due to the island being abandoned, or whether it was a case of in situ extinction of the island population. Lampert (1979) had investigated a similar mid-Holocene habitation cessation on Kangaroo Island, and although concluding that the population probably died out he could not dismiss the alternative possibility that people had watercraft and had ceased visiting or living on the island about 4,000 years ago. Unlike Kangaroo Island, the Fumeaux Group had outer islands which enabled the issue of watercraft use to be investigated and thus resolve the primary question of island abandonment or extinction. Results of surveys of the Outer Islands indicated that people in the Furneaux region in prehistoric times did not have watercraft and thus the mid-Holocene middens on Flinders Island were deposited by an isolated relict population. ...

With the imminent threat of inundation, people appear to have retreated to higher land, abandoning the peripheral exposed shelf areas; subsequent (re)colonisation of these relict shelf areas in their form as islands took place steadily from c.4200 BP, with increased intensity of occupation after 1300 BP. Possible links between the timing of island occupation, watercraft technology and the role of climate change are investigated, with more recent changes in the archaeological record of Vanderlin Island also examined in light of cultural contact with Macassans.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Sim:2014hawkesbury,"Two fluvial sediment cores taken from a floodplain of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system in the Sydney region, eastern Australia are dated using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to provide a reliable chronology essential for the management and planning of water resources. Nine charcoal 14C (AMS) dates constrain these OSL ages. Quartz extracted from seven OSL samples from each of the cores was measured using both single-grain and multi-grain OSL techniques. Three of the single-grain natural dose distributions appear to be well bleached, but the others appear to be incompletely bleached to various degrees. Three minimum-age models (MAM, MAMUL and IEU) are applied to the single-grain dose distributions. We conclude that these models give consistent age estimates. For one of the cores it appears to be necessary to use a minimum-age model to obtain accurate ages, but in the other core incomplete bleaching is probably less important than postdepositional mixing and mixing during sampling. As a result, the burial age is probably best estimated using the weighted average of the individual single-grain dose estimates. The application of multi-grain OSL techniques to these samples results in an average apparent age overestimation of ∼200 years, which is significant for these samples, but negligible for sediments older than a few thousand years. The intention is that the chronology obtained in this study will be used in conjunction with a proxy flood record, derived from floodplain sediments, to gain an understanding of the long-term variability in periods of high and low rainfall in eastern Australia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Singh:1981george,"The sedimentary record from Lake George provides the longest relatively continuous Quaternary continental sequence yet available from Australia, and may record one of the longest Upper Cainozoic lacustrine records in the world. Palaeomagnetic analysis of a 36 m core from the lake floor identifies a sequence of deposition extending through the Brunhes and Matuyama, to the Gauss magnetic Chron. A longer core from the same site, but with incomplete recovery, extends to 72 m in lacustrine sediment; the age of the base of this core estimated by extrapolation is between 4.2 and 7 Ma. As there are still older and deeper sediments in the basin, extending to an estimated depth of 134 m, the age of the tectonic formation of the Lake George basin must be reckoned as Middle Miocene or older. The pattern of facies organisation through time demonstrates a phase of deep water deposition extending from the base of the cored sequence (72 m) up to 51.5 m, at which time a major change took place. A disconformity developed at this level, associated with a period of deep weathering and a prolonged phase of slope mantle deposition (from 51.5 to 30.8 m). A gradual return to lacustrine environments, with diminishing proportion of slope wash detritus, resulted in increased rates of deposition coincident with the Jaramillo Subchron at 21.5 m. Thereafter, throughout the Brunhes magnetic Chron, lacustrine conditions dominated, varying from deep to lake dry conditions in a rhythmic fashion, and reflecting the major climatic oscillations of the past 700 000 years, becoming more regular in the past 400 000 years. The pollen analytical record of the upper 8.6 m, covering the last 350 000 years, provides the main framework for the reconstruction of climatic history. The pollen and algal records indicate a sequence of vegetation and lake level changes, in which four major glacial/interglacial cycles are correlated with stages 1 to 10 of the 180 marine record. This provides by far the longest continuous biostratigraphic framework for the Quaternary period in Australia. Comparison between the palaeoclimatic record and the lake level evidence shows that there is no simple correlation between the lake level fluctuations and the glacial/ interglacial oscillations. In fact, major falls in the lake level occured both at the peak of cold glacials and during the warm interglacials. Though the falls in the lake levels during a warm period (interglacial) can be explained by high rates of evaporation, drying during maximum cold can be explained best in terms of a fall in precipitation. Permanent to deep-lake conditions generally occurred during intermediate cool periods following warm intervals, when perhaps the seas were still warm and low rates of evaporation on land prevailed. On the other hand, short periods of shallow to deep lake levels also occurred during warm (interglacial) periods, showing that these were associated with reasonably high rates of precipitation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Singh:1981quaternary,"Studies on vegetational history using pollen analysis have been made for the best part of 70 years but complementary studies of fire history have been slow to develop. Such fire studies as are available do not extend, however, beyond the last 10,000 to 15,000 years of vegetational record (Iversen, 1964, 1969l Tsukada an ddeevey, 1967; Singh, 1971; Singh et al., 1974; Swain, 1973, 1978; Hope and peterson, 1976; Byrne et al., 1977; Mehringer et al., 1977; Cwynar, 1978). Excluding Antarctica, Australia is the driest continent and the indirect consequences of this dryness are best exemplified in the occurrence of fire across the continent (Beadle, 1940; Jacobs, 1955; Gardner, 1957; Lewis, 1962; Gilbert, 1963; Mount, 1964, 1969; Jackson, 1968). The Australian vegetation is subject to the influence of fire over a wide range of environments and vegetation types (McArthur, 1968, 1972; Leeper, 1970; Gill, 1975; Luke ad McArthur, 1978), a feature which is inescapably interwoven with the early evolutionary history of the flora and climate of this region (Gardner, 1959). The wide range of adaptations of the vast majority of the Australian flora to resistance against droughts and fire could not have evolved without a long period of selection, migrations, redistributions and extinctions through much geological time, although some of the most important taxa, such as Eucalyptus, were probably evolving actively even during the Quaternary (Walker, 1978). At present, most of the sclerophyll species, which constitute an overwhelming majority of the Australian flora, are not only considered fire-tolerant, but are sometmies classes as 'fire-requirers' and 'fire-promoters' (Jackson, 1968). It has even been suggested that the sclerophylls have acquired by selection the capacity to tolerate and use high fire frequencies in competitive balance with other communities and, in the process, they have become adapted to soils of low fertility (Jackson, 1968). As sections of the sclerophyll taxa may have been evolving in Australia since the early Tertiary (Burbidge, 1960), their initial adaptability to xeric conditions and fre may have been acquired sometime in the last 65 million years (m.y.).",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Singh:1985cainozoic,"The results of pollen, spore, algal and charcoal particle analyses from an 18 m core sample, dating from ca. 730000-0 a before present (B.P.), from Lake George are described along with an account of a five year study of modern pollen-rain from the same site. Also, pollen analyses of two isolated samples, dating about 4-7 Ma B.P., in a separate core from the same location are reported for comparison. The sedimentary sequence is dated by means of magnetostratigraphy and radiocarbon. The microfossil record from Lake George provides the longest relatively continuous Quaternary continental sequence yet available from Australia and may document one of the world's longest combined record of vegetation, bush-fires, lake levels and climates together with the record of accompanying plant migrations, redistributions and extinctions. It is so far the only chronologically secure Late Cainozoic palynological database available in Australia that spans the entire Brunhes Chron. The altitudinal shifts of vegetation belts inferred from the palynological sequence suggest significant past changes in terrestrial temperatures of the order of glacialinterglacial cycles. It is revealed that the upper treeline was depressed by 1200-1500 m and 300-600 m, respectively, during the glacial maxima and the cool-temperate intervals, and reverted during the interglacials. Assuming an average lapse rate of 0.7 °C per 100 m, the drop in mean temperature for the warmest month (January) with respect to the present during the glacial maxima and the cool-temperate periods respectively may have been about 8--10 °C and 2--4 °C. A series of about eight glacial-interglacial cycles (phases I-XIX ) are recognized during the Brunhes Chron at Lake George broadly corresponding to stages 1-19 of the deep sea 18O palaeotemperature record. A correlation between the palaeotemperature sequence and the former lake levels at Lake George is presented for the relatively more continuous section, ca. 350000-0 a B.P., with a view to resolve past precipitation changes. It is inferred that periods of considerably lower precipitation than at present prevailed during the glacial maxima. Conversely, periods of higher precipitation than at present occurred for some considerable lengths of time during the interglacials. In general terms, the precipitation levels increased during both interglacials and interstadials with respect to glacial maxima. The plant microfossil evidence indicates that Eucalyptus-dominated, dry sclerophyll (low, open) forests, now growing in the lake catchment, and probably elsewhere in southeastern Australia are the result of a comparatively recent development. It is shown that the relatively ' fire-sensitive' Casuarina-dominated forests, combined several equally or more 'fire-sensitive' rainforest taxa, dominated the vegetation for at least half a million years during all but the last two interglacials. The relatively 'fire-tolerant', Eucalyptus-dominated forests started to expand onwards from the last interglacial, some 130000 years ago, in conjunction with large increases in the amount of charcoal in the sediment. Since then, not only did the amount of charcoal remain at a generally high level but the overall dominance of open, eucalypt forest is maintained throughout during the warmer periods except for a cool-temperate interstadial interval (zone D) during the last glacial. The 'fire-sensitive' Casuarina (under 23 µm type) as well as all the rainforest taxa declined at the end of the last glacial and finally disappeared from the lake catchment during the Holocene, culminating in the total extinction of Casuarina type under 23 µm during the last few hundred years. Some of the changes in flora during the Brunhes Chron were undoubtedly the result of long-term climatic change but most appear to have been precipitated through increased fire-frequencies only during the last 130000 years (with the maximum impact occurring during the last 10000 years), probably on account of the bush-firing activities of early man in Australia. This presupposes the presence of the Aboriginal people some 90000 years earlier than the oldest available archaeological evidence for human occupation of the Australian continent, a proposition that remains to be tested by future archaeological investigations. In biogeographical terms, the studies reveal that a number of Gondwanic taxa, commonly seen during the late Tertiary in southeastern Australia, survived well into the Pleistocene and finally disappeared during the late Brunhes from Lake George.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Singh:1991frome,"Results are presented from stratigraphy, radiocarbon, and pollen analysis from Lake Frome, South Australia, close to the summer/winter rainfall boundary at 30° south latitude. The pollen sequence shows that tree vegetation was minor around 18,000 yr B.P. The landscape was dominated by chenopod low shrublands and ephemeral (Tubuliflorae) vegetation. By ∼17,000 yr B.P., Callitris moved in and rose to 25% of the pollen sum. Values of Casuarina, myrtaceous shrubs, Acacia, Dodonaea and Cyperaceae also rose at about the same time. Between ∼17,000 and ∼ 14,500 yr B.P., Callitris and Eucalyptus dominated the tree vegetation with Callitris reaching its maximum values. Eucalpt woodlands were associated with undershrubs belonging to Myrtaceae, Acacia, Dodonaea and Gyrostemonaceae, whereas Callitris woodlands had probably supported only a sparse understorey. Chenopodiaceae, today distributed mainly in the winter rainfall zone, continued to show high values (>; 25%). Gramineae, today associated with high summer rainfall, generally remained below 20%.

Archaeological excavations at Meiharo provide further insights into such relations around 500 cal BP, apparently shortly preceding the period of oral tradition. In doing so, Meiharo further contextualises the history of the ethnographically recorded hiri exchange system, a network of exchange partnerships which affected the lives of people living along at least 400 km of the PNG southern lowlands.

Skelly:2014thesis,"The ethnographically-described hiri has long raised questions concerning the history and origins of social interactions along the south coast of Papua New Guinea. A fundamental problem, however, has been a paucity of research chronologically enchaining material traces of the hiri that we have come to know from ethnohistorical sources with the material remains from more ancient periods of time. Such secure chronological seriation is of particular interest in the Gulf of Papua where data are limited. It is also of particular relevance to this region, as here a re-evaluation of the age of previously excavated sites and archaeological materials is overdue. Previous archaeological research has demonstrated that for the past two millennia, people in the Gulf of Papua have been exchanging pottery, and/or ideas about making pottery, along some 500 km of coastline, extending from at least as far east as present-day Port Moresby westward to the Kikori River. In addition, previous research had identified a lull in the arrival of pottery into the Kikori River region between c. 950-500 cal BP. Archaeological investigations presented here test the hypothesis that social and cultural interactions contracted eastward c. 950 cal BP and then expanded again after 500 cal BP when new relationships were established that led ultimately to the ethnographically-described hiri. Connecting the archaeology with the ethnography requires the identification of an unbroken chronological sequence of archaeological data. To achieve this, I have followed two archaeological site surveying strategies. ... [_truncated_]",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2023-01-11 09:28:48.149 +0100

Skelly:2018agila,"Accounts of New Guinea’s recent past are replete with both archaeological and ethnographic evidence of trade that indirectly connect virtually the entire country from coast to highland. One consequence has been a bias towards central places (e.g. Mailu Island) and/or large-scale production villages (e.g. of the Port Moresby region) as origin locations for distributed goods. Inversely, there has also been attention paid to distant, recipient points in the landscape (e.g. Gulf of Papua lowlands) where incoming traders turn back home to their originating villages. Less attention has been given to those extreme edges where separate networks indirectly connect. Here we present new evidence from Hood Bay on the south coast of PNG, a region that lies at a crossroads between the west-sailing Motu hiri and eastern Mailu Island ceramicists and seafaring traders. By being on the margins of each, Hood Bay is geographically well positioned to investigate changing inter-regional seafaring networks along a broad coastal expanse. We present initial results from excavations at the Agila village site, Hood Bay, where a changing incidence of western Motu and Mailu ceramics is evident.

More than 100 rock shelters were excavated during the program, resulting in the documentation of 22 rock-shelter sites with Pleistocene-age Aboriginal archaeological deposits. This paper presents the radiometric determinations for these Pleistocene rock-shelter sites, which collectively suggest that the eastern Plateau was occupied by 45000 years ago. The paper further develops a hypothesis that there was a substantial shift in the incidence and intensity of rock-shelter occupation during the Last Glacial Maximum, c.30000–20000 years ago, where there was a substantial downturn in the use of most rock-shelter sites, and in some instances rock shelters were abandoned.

Slack:2020early,"For over 30 years, the radiometric chronologies of Newman Rockshelter and Newman Orebody XXIX have been central to archaeological discussions on the Pleistocene Aboriginal occupation of the Hamersley Plateau and greater Pilbara region. Until 2009, these two sites were heralded as having the oldest evidence of human occupation on the plateau, dating to the last glacial maximum (LGM) ~ 26-20 ka. More recently however, the excavations at several other rockshelters have shown that ancient Aboriginal peoples occupied the Hamersley Plateau many thousands of years before the onset of the last glacial cycle, when regional climatic conditions were wetter and more amenable. This paper presents the results of our re-excavation of both Newman Rockshelter and Newman Orebody XXIX. Our research has resulted in the compilation and analysis of large lithic datasets for each of these sites and the construction of geo-chronologies using modern radiometric techniques, including AMS-radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence dating. These new radiometric chronologies and artefact data indicate that both sites were occupied between 45 and 40 ka. Despite having significant early occupational evidence, neither of the rockshelters present strong evidence for sustained or persistent site use during the LGM proper ca. 23e19 ka; however, there is substantial evidence for more routine occupation of these localities during the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The aims of the thesis are to characterize the archaeological record of the island, develop and test a predictive model of site location, and to develop an explanatory hypothesis for the variability in the archaeological record in terms of prehistoric Aboriginal subsistence and settlement. The predictive site location model holds that site location may be reliably predicted in terms of five variables: proximity to the shore, proximity to fresh water and fernroot, ground elevation, and vegetation type. The application of a principal components analysis to the site database is discussed with reference to the site location model. A current subsistence-settlement model is tested, refuted and modified. The modified model holds that there were at least two large ‘base‘ camps located on or near the coast from which a range of subsistence activities were undertaken. Smaller sites on the west coast and along the relic accretion ridges reflect north-south movement over the island. The application of a principal components analysis to the site database is discussed with reference to the subsistence-settlement model.

Smith:1997puritjarra,"At Puritjarra rock shelter a long comparative sequence permits detailed comparisons of luminescence and radiocarbon chronologies over 35,000 years. Both techniques produce self-consistent chronologies for the Puritjarra deposit, but observed discrepancies between luminescence dates on unburnt sediments and 14C, assays on charcoal are greater than reported elsewhere. TL ages are generally older than 14C ages but dates converge at depths below 70 cm, dating first significant human occupation of the rock shelter ∼35,000 years ago. The discrepancies are not removed by calibrating 14C dates or adjusting TL ages for lower water content of sediments. The 14C chronology is broadly supported by sedimentary or palaeobotanical evidence, stone artefact typology and other archaeological data. Radiocarbon dates on intact hearths agree with those on detrital charcoal. TL ages were arrived at using both total bleach and selective bleach methods and the latter agree with optical ages for the same samples.

Smith:2004sandy,"One of the distinctive features of Aboriginal groups in the Australian desert was the large geographical scale of these hunter-gatherer systems. The residential mobility of groups was invariably high, with some individuals regularly moving 200 kms or more, and this was coupled with exchange systems which moved goods across the continent or from coast to interior, often over distances >1000 km (Mulvaney 1976). The scale of these systems is much greater than those recorded for other comparable parts of the world (for example: for southern Africa see Mitchell 1996.

Smith:2008thirsty,"The archaeology of Glen Thirsty, a desert well in the Amadeus Basin, Central Australia, illustrates the changing relationship between the ranges and desert lowlands during the last 1500 years. Historical records and Aboriginal accounts of the site document the regional importance of Glen Thirsty as one of the few wells in this part of the desert. Archaeological excavations and rock art research show that despite its proximity to Puritjarra with its long, late Pleistocene record of occupation, Glen Thirsty only became an important focus of occupation after 1500 BP. Several lines of evidence independently suggest the establishment and consolidation of a new cultural and economic landscape in the Glen Thirsty area around this time. Growing population pressure and shifts in patterns of land-use and economy in the Central Australian ranges may have provided the impetus for more intensive use of the Glen Thirsty area, although the timing of this was constrained by climatic factors. As a rain-fed well in the lower part of the Amadeus Basin, Glen Thirsty is sensitive to shifts in palaeoclimate and its history reflects changes in regional rainfall patterns during the late Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Smith:2009puritjarra,"Puritjarra rock shelter provides a long record of late Quaternary vegetation in the Australian arid zone. Analysis of the sedimentary history of this rock shelter is combined with reanalysis of charcoal and phytolith records to provide a first-order picture of changing landscapes in western Central Australia. These show a landscape responding to increasing aridity from 45 ka with deflation of clay-rich red palaeosols (<45 ka) and sharp declines in grassland and other vegetation at 40–36 ka, and at the beginning of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (24 ka). Vegetation in the catchment of the rock shelter recovered after 15 ka with expansion of both acacia woodland and spinifex grasslands, registering stronger summer rainfall in the interior of the continent. By 8.3 ka re-vegetation of local palaeosols and dunes had choked off sediment supply to the rock shelter and the character of the sediments changed abruptly. Poaceae values peaked at 5.8 ka, suggesting the early–mid Holocene climatic optimum in Central Australia is bracketed between 8.3 and 5.8 ka. Local vegetation was disrupted in the late Holocene with a sharp decline in Poaceae at 3.8 ka, coinciding with an abrupt intensification of ENSO. Local grasslands recovered over the next two millennia and by 1.5 ka the modern vegetation appears to have become established.

Smith:2017aspects,"The ecology of the geographically restricted Atherton antechinus (Antechinus godmani) is poorly known. This trapping and radio-tracking study provides historical baseline information on its ecology. The Atherton antechinus foraged primarily at night in deep leaf litter and rotting logs. The sympatric, smaller rusty antechinus (A. adustus) was arboreal and active both day and night, suggesting resource partitioning between species. The diet of the Atherton antechinus included a significant component of beetles, centipedes, spiders, cockroaches, crickets, and ants; minor items included a frog and a skink. Declines in male condition of both antechinus species occurred in June-July. Free-living young of the rusty and the Atherton antechinus were first trapped in November and January, respectively. Minimum convex polygon home ranges for the Atherton antechinus were 2.5-5.8 ha for males and 3.6 ha for a female. Multiple nest sites were used by individual Atherton antechinuses with simultaneous sharing of nests observed only between sexes. A home range of a single female was overlapped by the home ranges of numerous males. The Atherton antechinus prefers contiguous areas of wet tropical upland rainforest with old-growth characteristics, including large old trees for nest sites, fallen woody debris and deep leaf litter for foraging.

We suggest that such pressure would also lead to concomitant shifts in the use of peripheral areas within individual foraging estates. A small archaeological excavation at NEP23, on Watarrka Plateau in Central Australia, provides a glimpse of this dynamic. Use of this site began around 1,350 cal BP. Given this site‘s marginal location, initiation of occupation at NEP23 reflects pressure to extend the exploitation of foraging territory otherwise centred on major springs and rock holes along the base of the Watarrka Plateau.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Souza:2019brazil,"The Atlantic Ocean coast region of southeast Brazil contains two coast-parallel mountain ranges (the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira) generated by tectonic activity pulses tens of millions years after the main continental rift event occurred around 120 Ma. Although the short-term erosion rates for the region are established, the relative importance of the factors controlling erosion is poorly constrained. We combine new and published catchment-averaged erosion rates (n = 48) using in situ-produced 10Be concentrations in quartz from river sediments to establish the regional erosion pattern. The river catchments are (i) escarpment topography, (ii) high-altitude low-relief and (iii) mixed topography, which record how escarpment fronts are migrating inland. Ocean-facing coastal escarpment catchments of the Serra do Mar (ε = 18–53 m/Ma) can be eroded approximately twice as fast as continent-facing escarpment catchments in the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira (ε = 7–24 m/Ma). The correlation between the normalized channel steepness index (ksn) and slope angle indicates that river incision and hillslope erosion processes combine to maintain the high relief. The Serra do Mar catchments define a mean slope angle threshold indicating that landslides are the dominant erosional process when slope angles in excess of ~30°. Tectonic activity is low and plays no significant role in driving erosion. A first-order relationship between erosion rate and precipitation-temperature across the region implies that climate plays a key role in soil production, river incision and in triggering erosional processes. Although the high topographic relief is a pre-condition for the occurrence of significant erosion, the climatic condition is the outlining factor of the regional variation in erosion rates.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

In 1967 the author carried out an archaeological. survey of south-east Buka and excavated on two major sites on Sohano Island and at Haugan Village on Buka. These excavations and surface Collections produced collections of pottery hitherto undescribed. To describe and analyse the pottery a descriptive code has been devised. By this code each rim shard is described in terms of its constituent features. To study the development of pottery-making on Buka and Sohano, attribute frequencies have been compiled for each time unit revealed by the excavations. Variations in these frequencies interpreted as reflecting changes of 0erainic style through time. On the most important attribute classes is that of paste, and eight major and minor paste categories have been established. Most of these divisions have been validated by petrological examination. Pastes, like styles, are shown to have temporal significance. From the excavations and surface collections, a sequence of six ceramic styles; constituting three ceramic traditions, is outlined. The modern industry is viewed as the terminal. point for the final style. this industry today is given in chapter x.

Study of the relationship between the introduction of the pottery and any prior populations in the area has been hampered by a paucity of open sites with long sequences bridging the pre-Lapita and post-Lapita phases. Our recent research in the Talasea area of West New Britain Province has located several such sites that allow us to begin to examine the relationships between these phases. In this paper we present some preliminary results of this research. We argue that current models underestimate the diversity of expression of Lapita in this region and raise the possibility that not all of the Talasea sites with Lapita pottery were part of the ‘Lapia cultural complex‘ (Green 1979, and this volume).

Kirch and Hunt (1988a, 1988b) see this as instantaneous in archaeological and radiocarbon terms, but Spriggs (1990) proposes a ‘pause‘ in the Bismarck Archipelago. We review the dates from the Bismarck area and note that two interpretations are possible, depending on which dates are accepted. Lapita pottery may have begun there later than the accepted date of cal. 3450-3550 B.P., or it could have begun in the Mussau Islands earlier than in New Britain. Both views raise questions about Lapita presence in this region and have implications for its spread to more southerly islands. A maximum time range of from cal. 3300 to 2100 B.P. is suggested for the Bismarck Archipelago, with most dates falling between 3100 and 2300 B.P.

Use of the island began c. 3340–3000 cal. bp, but no firm date can be suggested for the end of pottery use on the island.

A small group of finely made stemmed chert tools is identified as potentially valuables similar to stemmed obsidian tools of the Willaumez Peninsula obsidian source region.

Spiske:2020inundation,"Coastal boulder deposits and chevrons are two features whose origin have triggered controversial discussions. Boulders are often used as indicators of past tsunamis and storms, with the former interpretation in many cases preferred due to the clast size. Chevrons, defined as large parabolic sand bodies, were previously attributed to (mega-)tsunami, potentially caused by oceanic impacts, because of their dimensions, height above sea level and alignment of the central axis. This study documents that chevrons along the Quobba coast in Western Australia are parabolic dunes and not related to tsunami inundation; their age is consistent with an arid period at about 3 .9 to 2 .3 ka when the sea level was 1 to 2 m higher than today. The internal age distribution proves an inland migration. Weakly developed soil horizons represent phases of intermittent dune stabilization and later reactivation. The calculated velocities required for wind transport and the prevailing wind directions are consistent with on-site meteorological parameters. The boulders at Quobba are most likely to be remnants of in situ platform denudation that produces shell hash, coral clasts and boulders. An unknown portion of the boulders was certainly moved by tropical cyclones. A previously proposed tsunami origin is unsustainable because the observed features can be explained by processes other than tsunamis. Boulders were tilted during gravitative platform collapse, standing water caused dissolution of the boulder bottoms, creating 'pseudo-rockpools', consequently not applicable as upside-down criteria, and ages of attached encrusting organisms document their colonization at higher sea level and (sub)recent frequent inundation by wave splash during rough seas.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

These sought to provide a critical evaluation of the radiocarbon corpus and its interpretation (Spriggs 1989, 1990, Spriggs and Anderson 1993). Although not as explicitly listed as in the last of these papers, generally similar standards of 'chronometric hygiene' were applied in all three. But in the Island Southeast Asian sample the benefit of the doubt was given more often, because of the comparatively small number of radiocarbon determinations and the lack of detailed reporting of the contexts of a number of them. Results that would have been considered questionable in the East Polynesian context are therefore accepted in the earliest of the papers, and to a lesser extent in the second one.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,2022-10-09 20:06:12.275 +0200

The book attempts to fill a gap between general histories of the Pacific at too large a scale and the individual country histories which focus down too much.

However, they are under-studied, in decline and typically presumed to pre-date the 20th century. Here we investigate the origin of a scar with a stone tool embedded in the scar overgrowth, located in the Central Tablelands, New South Wales, on Wiradjuri Country. We consider three datasets for this purpose: the tree and scar features; macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the embedded stone; and chronology and age of the tree and scar. The origin of the scar and its relationship with the stone tool are unclear. However, the results, together with documentary and oral evidence, suggest that Aboriginal people quarried the stone and probably used it as a wedge to lever bark from the tree, or to make a sign. The results provide a rare glimpse into the continuation of Aboriginal cultural practices and knowledge transmission in the second half of the 20th century.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Stahle:2016cradle,"On centennial to millennial timescales fire regimes are driven by climate changes, vegetation composition and human activities. We reconstructed the postglacial vegetation and fire history based on pollen and charcoal data from a small lake in Cradle Mountain National Park and investigated the influence that climate, people, and vegetation had on past fire regimes. In the late-glacial period, a slowly warming climate led to a shift in vegetation from coniferous alpine shrubland to Phyllocladus woodland. During this period, fire activity was very low. The initial increase in fires occurred between 12,500 and 11,000 cal yr BP and led to a decline in forest taxa, a resurgence of grasses and a rise in the pyrophytic buttongrass Gymnoschoenus. The highest fire activity in the record occurred between 10,900 and 9400 cal yr BP, the warmest interval of the postglacial period based on independent proxy records. Subalpine trees had depressed levels of pollen during this time. After 9000 cal yr BP, fire activity declined substantially, and fire-sensitive rainforest reached its maximum extent ca. 8500--6500 cal yr BP. A major fire perturbation occurred ca. 3600 cal yr BP, and thereafter rainforest shifted to open Eucalyptus woodland. The comparison of reconstructed fire and vegetation history at Wombat Pool to climate records and archeological data indicated that climate was the primary driver of the observed changes. In the late glacial and early Holocene, climate warming and individual species dispersal traits likely drove changes in vegetation composition that in turn impacted the fire regime. A relatively wet mid-Holocene climate favored rainforest trees whereas the drier and more variable climate of the late Holocene contributed to a decline in rainforest and a shift toward mixed forest as wet sclerophyll elements increased. Archeological evidence suggests humans reoccupied the region ca. 4000 cal yr BP. This may have added an ignition source that was absent in the previous ca. 7000 years and may have contributed to the large fire event ca. 3600 cal yr BP. Although pre-European populations may have been a source of ignition locally, the reconstructed fire history trends from Cradle Mountain National Park match well with large-scale changes in climate patterns.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Stahle:2017cradle,"Fire activity was reconstructed at five sites and vegetation history at three sites in northwest Tasmania, Australia in order to examine the climate and human drivers of environmental change in the region. Watershed-scale reconstructions of fire were compared to regional vegetation history. Fire activity was very low until ca. 12,000 cal yr BP. An early-Holocene fire maximum, ca. 11,800–9800 cal yr BP, occurred during the warmest interval of the Holocene as recorded by regional paleoclimate proxy records. This period of elevated burning was also coincident with an increase in arboreal sclerophyll plant taxa. A maximum in rainforest taxa occurred at ca. 8500-5800 cal yr BP concurrent with sharply diminished biomass burning compared with the early Holocene. The increase in rainforest taxa is attributed to elevated effective moisture during this period. Conditions were drier and variable in the late Holocene as compared with earlier periods. A rise in fire activity at ca. 4800-3200 cal yr BP was accompanied by an increase in sclerophyll taxa and decline of rainforest and subalpine taxa. Elevated palynological richness during the late Holocene co-occurred with high levels of charcoal suggesting that fires promoted high floristic diversity. At Cradle Mountain, there is no clear evidence that fire regimes or vegetation were extensively modified by humans prior to European settlement. Climate was the primary driver of fire activity over millennial timescales as explained by the close relationship between charcoal and climate proxy data.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

Starke:2017chile,"In the arid region of northern Chile the environmental conditions are favorable for measuring tectonic and climatic influences on catchment denudation rates in the absence of vegetation. Previous studies of denudation rates from cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations are limited to single drainages. In this study, we examine catchment‐ to orogen‐scale spatial variation in denudation rates between 18 and 23°S in the Coastal and Western Cordilleras of northern Chile. 10Be and 26Al data were obtained from 33 catchments to examine the relative roles of tectonics and climate on catchment‐averaged denudation rates. At broader scales, we examine whether denudation rates and orogen topography reflect the 3‐D plate geometry of the region. Cosmogenic nuclide‐derived denudation rates range from 0.4 ± 0.5 to 20.6 ± 1.5 m/Myr in the Coastal Cordillera and from 1.4 ± 0.7 to 168.0 ± 19.8 m/Myr in the Western Cordillera. The controls on the denudation rates are evaluated using a statistical factor analysis of 10 selected catchment parameters. Denudation rates indicate a strong linear relationship with channel steepness indices but insignificant correlations and covariation with mean annual precipitation rates, drainage area, stream order, mean elevation, mean local relief, mean basin slope, and grain size of the sampled sediments. Moreover, denudation rates are better correlated with tectonic controls at catchment scale than orogen‐scale plate tectonics in the Western and Coastal Cordillera.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We address these complexities along 3500 kilometers of the extreme climate and vegetation gradient of the Andean Western Cordillera (6°S to 36°S latitude) using 86 cosmogenic radionuclide–derived, millennial time scale erosion rates and multivariate statistics. We identify a bidirectional response to vegetation’s influence on erosion whereby correlations between vegetation cover and erosion range from negative (dry, sparsely vegetated settings) to positive (wetter, more vegetated settings). These observations result from competing interactions between precipitation and vegetation on erosion in each setting.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Beyond this region to the east, however, no archaeological site pre-dates 3500 BP. This dramatic discontinuity in time raises the question of whether an earlier migration beyond the Solomons may have taken place and it is this possibility that has been examined for New Caledonia. Sediment from Saint Louis Lac in the south of the main island was analysed for indirect indicators of human impact. Changes in charcoal influx and vegetation indicative of disturbance (ferns and grass) were examined. These were analysed in conjunction with the site‘s changing stratigraphy, sedimentation rates and mineral magnetic properties. Grass pollen and fern spores abruptly increase around 3000 BP which corresponds with a significant change in charcoal influx. Human activity, within the vicinity of Saint Louis Lac, is therefore interpreted as commencing around 3000 BP, a finding in close accordance with New Caledonia‘s current archaeological record.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Stevenson:1998melanesian,"Relatively little is known of the long term environmental history of tropical south Pacific islands. In addition there is some debate as to whether pollen evidence for vegetation disturbance in the late Holocene is an appropriate proxy for human presence and whether such evidence can contribute to debates concerning island colonisation in the south Pacific. This thesis reports the results of vegetation history analyses carried out in New Caledonia. Three lowland sites from the main island (all below 10 m asl) were investigated using pollen and spore counts, charcoal counts and stratigraphic analysis. Plum Swamp on the leeward coast of New Caledonia provides a continuous record from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present, while the sediments analysed from Lac Saint Louis and Canala Swamp are mid to late Holocene in age. The results of the study are: 1) Littoral forest and lowland rainforest in the Plum River Valley did not undergo dramatic change during the last glacial maximum. The valley remained forested. 2) Vegetation disturbance associated with fire occurred between 16- 12,000 yr BP, but the composition of the vegetation did not change significantly. 3) Present day climatic conditions appear to have been in place around 12,000 yr BP. 4) A dramatic vegetation shift from littoral forest and lowland rainforest to a Melaleuca woodland and open shrubland occurred around 3000 yr BP, coinciding with the commencement of the archaeological record for the island. Plum is one of only two truly lowland sites in the tropics to record persistent rainforest cover during the LGM. This suggests that reduction of precipitation during the LGM in tropical islands may not be as great as generally thought. Given the lack of data from Pacific islands, this has important implications for global reconstructions of LGM climate. While vegetation disturbance caused by fire has a long history in the New Caledonian environment, it is the arrival of people at around 3000 yr BP that has had the most dramatic impact on the island's vegetation since the LGM. The pollen records suggest that the vegetation surrounding the sites has changed little over the last 3000 years.",2023-01-05 16:42:05.198 +0100,

From ∼120,000 to ∼50,000 yr ago the vegetation around Lake Xere Wapo alternated between rainforest and maquis with fire an important disturbance factor. In the last 50,000 yr fire is almost absent from the record and the vegetation assumes a character unprecedented in the preceding 100,000 yr, dominated by Dacrydium and Podocarpus pollen. The most compelling aspect of the comparison with Lynch‘s Crater is that the much-discussed Araucaria decline at around 45,000 yr ago in northern Queensland is matched by a similar decline in the Lake Xere Wapo record.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Stevenson:2015weipa,"The environmental history of Big Willum (Waandriipayn) Swamp and the surrounding landscape is reconstructed for the last 8000 years through the analysis of pollen, charcoal and mineral magnetics. The data provide a Holocene record of vegetation and fire in an area where few records exist. Swamp initiation at Big Willum began prior to 8000 cal. BP, with swamp-like conditions maintained until 2200 cal. BP, after which it became a permanent deep water body, reaching its present day extent between 600--400 cal. BP. From 7000--1200 cal. BP the surrounding woodland was essentially stable. Fire is present throughout the record, with only one period of pronounced burning outside of the historic period, at around 1000 cal. BP, leading to a slightly more open understorey/woodland. The hydrological change at 2200 cal. BP that led to Big Willum becoming a more permanent water body overlaps with the end of the most intensive period of shell mound formation and the commencement of earth mound building at nearby Wathayn. This is suggestive that change in, or diversification of, mound types may in part be linked to environmental transformations in the late Holocene.

Stock:2009wasatch,"We evaluate spatial and temporal variations in denudation of the north-central Wasatch Mountains, Utah, by determining catchment-wide denudation rates with 10Be concentrations in alluvial sediment and comparing these rates with previously published data on rock uplift and exhumation of the range. Catchments draining the range front show relatively little variation in denudation rate (0.07–0.17 mm/yr), while steeper (mean hillslope gradient >30°) catchments in the core of the range show larger variation (0.17–0.79 mm/yr). We attribute the larger spatial variation in catchment-wide denudation in the core of the range to landsliding of hillslopes at threshold gradients; faster denudation in this region may signify landscape adjustment to late Pleistocene glaciations. The mean denudation rate for all catchments (0.2 mm/yr) is generally consistent with longer-term exhumation rates derived from thermochronometers and with shorter-term vertical fault displacement rates, suggesting that denudation of the north-central Wasatch has been roughly steady, or decreasing slightly, over the past 5 m.y. Although 10Be-based catchment-wide denudation rates are sensitive to localized geomorphic processes and events, overall, they appear to reflect the larger tectonic forces that have driven denudation of the Wasatch Mountains over longer time scales.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Stone:1992weipa,"The shell mounds at Weipa on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula are thought by archaeologists to be among the world's largest prehistoric middens. The mounds appear to be composed almost entirely of whole and fragmented shell valves of the cockle Anadara granosa and artefacts have been recovered from them. Stone (1989), however, proposed that the tall, steep-sided shell mounds were not built by shellfishing Aborigines but by generations of mound-building Scrubfowl Megapodius r einwar dt. This thesis aims to determine the tenability of the Scrubfowl hypothesis by first testing the hypothesis of human origin. It then aims to establish a geographical and chronological context in which to interpret the origins of the shell mounds. From the literature it is evident that physical and biological processes of mound formation are far more certain and universal than cultural processes. Cheniers and barriers are common features of the world's coastlines and may form mounds through quirks of sediment supply or erosion. Mound-building organisms include megapodes, termites and ants, alligators and crocodiles, and fossorial rodents. Human occupation mounds are distinguishable by architectural features and related cultural remains. Mounds of doubtful human origin include the shell mounds of the Americas, Europe and southeast Asia. These mounds have morphostratigraphic features which strongly suggest that they are natural shoreline deposits, not massive shell middens. In the Andaman Islands, New Caledonia and southeastern Australia there are also mounds considered cultural in origin which may have been built by megapodes. ...

Stone:1995mound,"Shell mounds are late Holocene deposits typically dominated by a single shell species. In northern Australia these mounds are associated with prograding coastal plains. The largest and most numerous are at Weipa on Cape York Peninsula. Archaeologists claim that these mounds were formed by generations of shellfishing Aborigines. This hypothesis is false because most of the shells from the type-site are of a similar radiocarbon age. Mapping and augering of two contrasting shell mound environments along the Mission River at Weipa demonstrates that mound formation is a natural consequence of local chenier plain development. This is supported by shell ages from across the Weipa landscape. The shell mounds at Prumanung originated as a coarse shell berm. The large mounds on the Uningan plain originated as small shell cheniers. The only reasonable explanation for the transformation of these natural shell deposits into tall, steep-sided mounds is the mound-building behaviour of the Orange-footed Scrubfowl Megapodius reinwardt. Similar mounds composed predominantly of sand and gravel are also present at these localities. The strong likelihood that the shell mounds are natural shell deposits raises serious questions about basic principles of shell midden archaeology. New methods for distinguishing between cultural and natural shell deposits are needed.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Stone:2006cadell,"A record of climatic, hydrological and tectonic change spanning the last glacial cycle (-130,000 years) has been obtained from alluvial, aeolian and lacustrine sequences in the Cadell Tilt Block region of the central Murray Basin. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is the principal method of chronological control, with a total of 50 new luminescence ages. Two AMS radiocarbon (^14C) ages are supplementary. Soils are used for relative dating of landforms beyond the range of OSL and ^14C. The result is the largest corpus of late Quaternary ages ever produced for the region. The chronology of the Lake Tyrrell lunette sequence has been revised from previously published interpretations. Beach sediments ~13.5 m above the present lake floor were deposited by Lake Chillingollah, a marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 5 (~ 130,000- 75,000 years ago) megalake. The megalake dried because of decreasing winter rainfall and fragmented into a groundwater discharge system. A silty clay dune deflated from the Lake Tyrrell floor ~27,000 years ago ended a long period of pedogenesis and buried evidence for Aboriginal visits to the lakeshore. The earliest evidence for aridification along the Murray River is an episode of riverine source-bordering dune formation in early MIS 4 (~72,000 years ago). The event is a minimum age for the initiation of construction of the Barmah Fan, which accreted in response to uplift of the Cadell Tilt Block. Fan sedimentation on the foot wall close to the fault scarp appears to have accelerated between 65,000 and 45,000 years ago. The Green Gully palaeochannel on the uplifted block was abandoned by the Murray River soon after this period, which culminated in an episode of riverine source-bordering dune formation ~40,000 years ago. The Goulburn River was not defeated by uplift. An older prior stream on the uplifted block, with undatable strong red-brown earth soil profiles along its margins, is not a course of the Goulburn. Instead, the Goulburn River was deflected to the southwest where it developed the Tallygaroopna meander belt ridge. This course had been deflected by ~65,000 years ago. Vertical aggradation of the ancestral Goulburn continued until ~23,000 years ago. Riverine source-bordering dunes were beginning to form again when a clay plug filled the palaeochannel. The Tallygaroopna meander belt ridge is visible beneath the floor of Lake Kanyapella on LIDAR DEM imagery. Downstream it follows the course of Gunbower Creek. Lake Kanyapella is not fault-dammed or fault-controlled because it post-dates formation of the ridge. The lake formed ~34,000 years ago and was sustained by flows from the Tallygaroopna palaeochannel for ~10,000 years. A model of lake formation is proposed based on vertical bedload aggradation. That is, the lake emerged because the Goulburn River had fully-aggraded and could no longer channel its flood flows. This long-term ponding may be of wider palaeohydrological significance. Riverine source-bordering dunes form only at the end of the lacustral period. The Goulburn River avulsed from the meander belt ridge at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (~18,000 years ago). The Kotupna palaeochannel was rapidly entrenched and back-filled, with riverine source-bordering dunes emplaced along its course in a geological instant. The harsh climate of the LGM was adapted to by the Kow Swamp people who developed robust physical morphologies in response to the cold conditions. Gracilization of the population is related to post-glacial climatic amelioration, which increased gene flow. Robust humans are rare after the LGM. Palaeochannel morphology is not climatically-controlled. Kotupna-type bars were deposited along the Bullatale Creek course of the Murray River in the Holocene, without any concomitant source-bordering dune formation. The Barmah Choke reach of the Murray River is relatively straight because it is a modern avulsion, not an inert Holocene river course. This avulsion happened only ~550 years ago, effectively shutting down the depositional system that constructed the massive Wakool Fan. This event ended a 75,000 year long avulsion sequence.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Stone:2006tyrell,"Lake Tyrrell is the largest playa in the Murray Basin of southeast Australia. Optical dating of transverse dune (lunette) sediments extends the lake's radiocarbon chronology to the last interglacial period. The highest lake level was attained 131,000~±~10,000~yr ago, forming Lake Chillingollah, a megalake that persisted until around 77,000~±~4000~yr ago. Pedogenesis of its sandy lunette continued until buried by a silty clay lunette deflated from the lake floor 27,000~±~2000~yr ago. The dated soil-stratigraphic units correlate with the upper Tyrrell Beds and contain evidence that humans visited the lakeshore before 27,000~yr ago. The Lake Chillingollah megalake was synchronous with very high lake levels in monsoon-dominated Australia, yet it was not influenced by tropical monsoon systems. It was filled instead by increased winter rainfall from westerly low-pressure fronts. Greater effective precipitation across Australia is evident, the result of a weakened subtropical high-pressure zone.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Stone:2016murray,"The modern course of the Murray River flows south around the Cadell Tilt Block in southeastern Australia. The avulsion that took the river in this direction formed the Barmah Choke, a reach with an unusually straight planform. This morphology has been used to argue Holocene inertia of the modern river system. The avulsion was initially placed at ∼ 10 ka on the basis of a single charcoal age. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and AMS 14C dating of deposits along the Barmah Choke demonstrates that the Murray has not been inert during this period. A digitate delta deposited on the floor of a palaeolake by the avulsion is only ∼ 550 years old. Point bar deposition along the Choke also began around this time. The Murray River probably followed the course of Bullatale Creek for most of the Holocene. It formed large, inset meander scrolls of Pleistocene Kotupna-type along this creek course but without source-bordering dunes. The persistence of Kotupna-type bedload along this course suggests that there was no simple switch to suspended load channels at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. The Barmah Choke avulsion trebled the discharge of the Goulburn River causing morphological adjustment and formation of new reaches downstream. The extensive Barmah and Gunbower-Koondrook red gum forests probably arose from the increased flood flows. Pollen and spores from lacustrine sediments beneath the Choke show that the vegetation ∼ 4000 years ago was very different. The lake and hinterland began to dry from this time and the lake became a swamp. A pedogenic interval shows that the swamp was dry for lengthy periods prior to deposition of the digitate delta.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

By comparing 56 new cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al measurements in stream sediments with matching data (n= 55) from source areas, we show that 10Be–26Al inventories in hillslope bedrock and soils set the benchmark for relative downstream modifications.

Struth:2016colombia,"Catchment‐wide erosion rates were defined using 10Be terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides for the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes to help determine the nature of drainage development and landscape evolution. The Eastern Cordillera, characterized by a smooth axial plateau bordered by steep flanks, has a mean erosion rate of 11 ± 1 mm/ka across the plateau and 70 ± 10 mm/ka on its flanks, with local high rates >400 mm/ka. The erosional contrast between the plateau and its flanks was produced by the increase in the orogen regional slope, derived from the progressive shortening and thickening of the Eastern Cordillera. The erosion rates together with digital topographic analysis show that the drainage network is dynamic and confirms the view that drainage divides in the Eastern Cordillera are migrating towards the interior of the mountain belt resulting in progressive drainage reorganization from longitudinal to transverse‐dominated rivers and areal reduction of the Sabana de Bogotá plateau.

Sullivan:1982phd,"This thesis is concerned with the nature and distribution of prehistoric Aboriginal shell middens in the coastal zone of New South Wales. As such it is a study in landscape archaeology in which the relationships between the contents and locations of shell middens and the physical environments of coastal New South Wales are considered. Shell middens are investigated within a framework of landscape units in which the New South Wales coastline is divided into four regions, based on geological structure. Eight hundred shell middens recorded over the entire length of the coast line have been used to analyse patterns of content, dimensions, locational variilbles and distribution with respect to these landscape units. From the results of this analysis it is argued that there between she 11 middens and the landscapes in are strong relationship which they occur, and that the coastal landscape has to a considerable extent influenced Loastal prehistory. Because this overview of sites takes no account of different temporal patterns, nor of the degree of site destruction through time, more detailed studies are included to examine these aspects. In addition for the far souch coast, where no detailed archaeological investigation had been carried out previously, a shell midden was excavated.

Sullivan:2007blue,"The Blue Ridge escarpment, located within the southern Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and North Carolina, forms a distinct, steep boundary between the less rugged lower-elevation Piedmont and higher-elevation Blue Ridge physiographic provinces. The rugged topography of the Blue Ridge escarpment and the antiquity of the passive margin of eastern North America have lead to questions about the rates and patterns of erosion that have acted on the escarpment over time. It is generally agreed that great escarpments, like the Blue Ridge escarpment, are the result of rifting. There are two primarily accepted models explaining the evolution of passive margin escarpments: evolution from slow and irregular inland erosional retreat of the primary rift shoulder and drainage divide, and evolution from rapid and significant erosion immediately following rifting with subsequent stability of the resulting passive margin. The passive margin of eastern North America is old; rifting terminated ~200 Ma. Thus, a clear understanding of the processes controlling the erosion and evolution of the Blue Ridge escarpment may provide insight about the geomorphic evolution of similar escarpments on younger passive margins. To understand better the geomorphic evolution of the Blue Ridge escarpment and to investigate how quickly this landform and its adjacent physiographic provinces are changing, I measured cosmogenic 10Be in sediment (n=47) from stream basins (n=29) and in exposed bedrock (n=3) along four transects normal to the escarpment.

Switzer:2006washover,"Prehistoric depositional signatures for large-scale washover involving marine inundation events such as storms and tsunami have been the subject of considerable research over the last 15 years. Much of this research has focused on the identification of sandsheets in back-barrier environments as depositional records for extreme washover events. All these deposits must have a sediment source and, by their nature, the most likely source of sediment for washover into back-barrier environments is the barrier itself. This study identifies an erosional signature for large-scale washover from a small coastal barrier on the southeast Australian coast. A distinct lens of marine sand, up to 90 cm thick, confined vertically by peat, is found in the upper fill of a closed freshwater back-barrier lagoon sequence. This sand lens is attributed to a large-scale washover event during the last 800 years, and was possibly deposited by a tsunami. The hypothesis for this study was that any event that breached the dune system must have caused considerable geomorphic change to the dunes and hence may have left an erosional signature. Ground penetrating radar transects of the system show an erosional contact between a series of truncated pre-event dunes and several small overlying post-event dunes. This study outlines a relatively simple non-invasive method for the identification of an erosional signature for prehistoric large-scale washovers caused by storm surge, exceptionally large waves, or tsunami.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Tamura:2017cowley,"Storm surges generated by tropical cyclones have been considered a primary process for building coarse-sand beach ridges along the north-eastern Queensland coast, Australia. This interpretation has led to the development of palaeotempestology based on the beach ridges. To better identify the sedimentary processes responsible for these ridges, a high-resolution chronostratigraphic analysis of a series of ridges was carried out at Cowley Beach, Queensland, a meso-tidal beach system with a >3 m tide range. Optically stimulated luminescence ages indicate that 10 ridges accreted seaward over the last 2500 to 2700 years. The ridge crests sit +3 .5 to 5 .1 m above Australian Height Datum (ca mean sea-level). A ground-penetrating radar profile shows two distinct radar facies, both of which are dissected by truncation surfaces. Hummocky structures in the upper facies indicate that the nucleus of the beach ridge forms as a berm at +2 .5 m Australian Height Datum, equivalent to the fair-weather swash limit during high tide. The lower facies comprises a sequence of seaward-dipping reflections. Beach progradation thus occurs via fair-weather-wave accretion of sand, with erosion by storm waves resulting in a sporadic sedimentary record. The ridge deposits above the fair-weather swash limit are primarily composed of coarse and medium sands with pumice gravels and are largely emplaced during surge events. Inundation of the ridges is more likely to occur in relation to a cyclone passing during high tide. The ridges may also include an aeolian component as cyclonic winds can transport beach sand inland, especially during low tide, and some layers above +2 .5 m Australian Height Datum are finer than aeolian ripples found on the backshore. Coarse-sand ridges at Cowley Beach are thus products of fair-weather swash and cyclone inundation modulated by tides. Knowledge of this composite depositional process can better inform the development of robust palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from the ridges.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,
Tamura:2019modelling,"Optically-stimulated luminesecne (OSL) dating, in concert with two-dimensional ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiling, has contributed to significant advances in our understanding of beach-ridge systems and other sedimentary landforms in various settings. For recent beach-ridges, the good OSL properties of coastal quartz permit a high sample throughput thanks to shorter measurement times and simpler sample preparation prompting the collection of more samples at higher sampling resolution. However, sampling at high resolution increases the chance of age inversions because random errors between samples may be larger than the difference in sample ages. Age inversions can be avoided, however, if the stratigraphic constraints are included in the age estimation process. Here, we create a custom Bayesian chronological model for a recent (<500 yr) beach-ridge sequence in Moruya, southeast Australia, for direct comparison with a GPR profile. The model includes a full 'burial-dose model' for each sample and a dose rate term with the modelled ages constrained by the vertical and shore-normal sample order. The modelled ages are visualized by plotting isochrones on the beach-ridge cross section, and validated against a beach monitoring dataset. The modelling approach allows a more detailed interpretation of the Moruya beach-ridge system; when combined with higher-resolution sampling, the approach will increase the precision of beach-ridge chronologies and provide further insights into their formative processes.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Increasing populations worldwide, together with sea level rise, exacerbate concerns for coastal settlements, but the low frequency of extreme storms makes an assessment of risk difficult. In southeast Australia, the severest beach retreat on record relates to a series of extratropical cyclones in the 1970s, but the relatively short observational record hinders assessment of how frequent these events are. At Moruya in New South Wales, four decades of beach monitoring has provided new insights into response of beaches to extreme storms. We augment this recorded history with morphostratigraphic analysis of beach ridge evolution by using ground-penetrating radar and optically stimulated luminescence dating. We find an episode of extreme retreat over 550 years, proving that the 1970s extreme event is a recurrent phenomenon. Our high-precision morphostratigraphic analysis provides evidence with which to better plan coastal adaptation.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

Telfer:2017dunefield,"The controls on the evolution of linear dunefields are poorly understood, despite the potential for reactivation of dunefields, which are currently stabilized by vegetation, under the influence of 21st century climate change. The relative roles of local influences (i.e. boundary conditions) and morphodynamic influences (i.e. emergent properties) remain unclear. Chronostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses were conducted on two pairs of linear dunes exhibiting different spatial patterning in the Strzelecki Desert of central Australia. It was hypothesized that morphodynamic influences, via pattern-coarsening, would mean that dunes from the simpler pattern, defined in terms of the frequency of defects (i.e. junctions and terminations), would be more mature, older landforms. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of full-depth, regularly-sampled profiles was used to establish accumulation histories for the four dunes, and supported by sedimentological analysis to investigate possible compositional differences and similarities between the dunes. Whilst three of the dunes (the two more simply-patterned dunes, and one of the more complex dunes) have accumulation histories beginning between ~100ka and 150ka, and document sporadic net accumulation throughout the last interglacial/glacial cycle to the late Holocene, one of the dunes (with relatively complex patterning) reveals that the majority of the dune accumulation (>7m) at that site occurred during a relatively short window at ~50ka. There is no clear sedimentological reason for the different behaviour of the younger dune. The data suggest that small-scale and essentially stochastic nature of the aeolian depositional/erosional system can overprint any large-scale morphodynamic controls. The concept of dating landscape change by pattern analysis is thus not supported by this study, and would require very careful interpretation of the scales being considered. This further suggests caution when interpreting dune chronostratigraphies palaeoenvironmentally, as different dunes are able to respond very differently to the same external stimulus (e.g. climate). In the case studied here, a mechanism is proposed to account for the rapid accumulation of the anomalous dune by avulsion of the local aeolian accumulation from one dune ridge to another.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Terrell:2002tropical,"A fundamental concern in archaeology and anthropology is understanding the relationships between population growth, the development of complex societies, and the shift in prehistoric times from foraging to food production. That there are connections between these historical processes has long been apparent. Precisely how they are interrelated is controversial. Frequently discussed is the lack of agreement on what characterizes complex or simple societies. It is less widely recognized that the subsistence practices of many communities in the region that van Steenis called eastern Malesia (the Celebes, Moluccas, and New Guinea) cannot be positioned unambiguously along a typological spectrum between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists. Modern research indicates that people in this region have long been following broad-spectrum approaches to subsistence that have made agriculture or horticulture the mainstay only where (and when) local circumstances have narrowed their subsistence strategies. Today the lagoons at Sissano and elsewhere on the Sepik coast of northern Papua New Guinea are complex, highly productive habitats (fish and shellfish as well as extensive mangrove and sago swamps) that support some of the largest village communities on the coast. Systematic ethnographic and archaeological research in the Aitape district since 1990 has led us to rethink the Holocene foundations of subsistence and demography in the western Pacific. We hypothesize that around 6,000 years ago newly forming lagoons along New Guinea’s long northern coastline may have started to be productive enough in conjunction with already established traditions of agroforestry to fuel culture change in the voyaging corridor between Asia and the Pacific that had far-reaching ramifications.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

A plausible reason for the persistence of this iconography is that it has referred to ideas about the living and the dead, the human and the divine, and the individual and society that remained socially and spiritually profound and worth expressing long after the demise of Lapita as a distinct ceramic style. We detail evidence for saying that the ‘faces‘ on Lapita vessels from thousands of years ago and certain stylized designs on historic and modern carved wooden bowls and platters from this coast are historically linked ways of alluding to sea turtles, creatures figuring prominently in the lore and cosmology of Pacific Islanders.

Although Lapita peoples have been traditionally characterised as ‘marine specialists‘, relatively little is known about their shellfish subsistence economies in comparison to their distinctive ceramic traditions. This thesis primarily focuses on understanding temporal and spatial changes in how shellfish were exploited throughout the antiquity of human occupation at Caution Bay, especially in relation to before, during and after contact with Lapita peoples. Results have revealed significant changes in distribution, availability and exploitation of shellfish species over time. Trends are particularly prevalent before, during and after periods of ‘contact‘ when the established indigenous population met and interacted with Lapita ‘foreigners,. This is supported by the archaeological evidence with an intensification of shellfish resources and site use and extension of human predation pressures coinciding with the introduction of new material culture (i.e. pottery). ...

The study aims to resolve whether two individuals from the Macassan site originate from outside Arnhem Land and, if so, whether their place of origin can be determined. Strontium results confirm the Macassan and Indigenous samples represent two distinct populations. The Indigenous values match the local Arnhem Land geologic strontium signatures, while the Macassan values are outside the local range and more likely to match Indonesian geological signatures. Carbon isotope results are more equivocal, but tend to support the presence of two populations by revealing slightly different dietary backgrounds for each group. Oxygen isotope data introduce more complexity; their geographic signal may be confounded by cultural behaviour.

ThedenRingl:2016capital,"Despite sporadic archaeological work spanning five decades, the chronology of Aboriginal presence in the mountains of southeast Australia remains poorly understood. Characterised by steep slopes and rugged terrain, this region has possibly always been a marginal area for human habitation, and its occupation chronology can thus play an important role in assessing competing hypotheses regarding past population expansions and cultural responses to environmental change. To improve our understanding of Aboriginal high country chronology, several rockshelters in the Namadgi Ranges in the Australian Capital Territory were excavated. A series of radiocarbon dates from these excavations and a generalised chronostratigraphy of this area are described in this report. Cultural deposits dating to the early to mid-Holocene provide the first substantial evidence that people were active in the high country during the Holocene Optimum (ca 9,000-6,000 years BP). In combination with previously dated Namadgi sites, the new data also confirm an increase in activity at around 2,000 years BP. An apparent decrease in cultural evidence dating to between 4,500 and 2,000 years BP is in contrast to major cultural and population shifts seen in the southeast Australian archaeological record during this time, but whether this reflects an actual behavioural trend or results from external processes affecting cultural deposits is still unclear.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
ThedenRingl:2017xray,"Archaeological sediments retain elements from natural and anthropogenic inputs for many years, often forming stratified geochemical records of site formation and human use. This study evaluates the validity and potential of an X-ray fluorescence core scanner (XRF-CS) to contribute to the histories of stratified archaeological sites. Geochemical data sets from an archaeological deposit at Wee Jasper in southeast Australia are obtained using two sediment preparation techniques; the results are compared to trends identified through cultural artefacts and several more traditional methods of sediment analysis. Potential anthropogenic and organic element signatures are identified, and the sediment preparation techniques are evaluated. Minimally processed bulk samples provide consistent XRF results that strongly correlate with the trends observed in other proxies; results from unprocessed sediment columns, however, reveal methodological complications with the XRF-CS technique due to topographical and structural inconsistencies in the columns.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
ThedenRingl:2020characterizing,"We explore the potential contribution of faunal assemblages from the Australian Alps and surrounding regions towards the characterization of climate and landscape change, and for geochronological species distribution mapping. The limitations of existing faunal sites and collections - their rarity, their stratigraphic integrity and resolution, and accurate dating of their histories - are discussed in a regional review of known and potential assemblages and locations. We also revisit a faunal sequence from a stratified cave deposit at Wee Jasper, focusing on a Holocene ‘climatic optimum‘ phase. A suite of species fluctuations between 8000 and 6000 cal. BP suggests responses to local changes such as a warmer and possibly moister environment, with probable associated vegetation shifts. For example, eucalypt forests had replaced more open communities across the region by 8600 cal. BP, and were generally dominant until after 6000 cal. BP. Several faunal species are examined in a regional context using available chronologically defined species histories. Emerging robust multi-proxy investigations demonstrate the potential of faunal assemblages for the development of geographically detailed histories of species that can provide indications of palaeoenvironments. This approach can be strengthened by increasing resolution and developing improved age models in presently known fauna-bearing sites.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Thom:1994coastal,"The Last Glacial Maximum or LGM (25,000-15,000 yr B.P.) has been recognized in Australia as a period of increased dryness, coolness, continentality and windiness compared to earlier and later period Enhanced aeolian activity during the LGM occurred in arid and semi-arid regions of western, central and eastern Australia. The east coast has been considered to have been better watered and vegetated. However, at a number of sites from Tasmania to North Queensland, there is evidence for extensive aeolian instability of coastal sand deposits. Dating by radiocarbon and thermoluminiscence techniques has supported morphologic and stratigraphic evidence of dune formation during the LGM under the influence of westerly (offshore) winds in the southern sector of the east coast (i.e. south of 31°S latitude) and southeast winds to the north. It is now apparent that vegetation cover on sandy surfaces was quite patchy during the LGM. Sand surface instability under conditions of strong west or southeast winds promoted linear and/or parabolic dune development. This suggests greater concentration of forests in more discrete, protected sites along the eastern escarpment than was previously considered by palaeoecologists. More widespread drier and cooler climatic conditions operated even in coastal regions on expanded continental shelves at this time. Stabilization of areas of active dunes became more likely as sea levels rose, reduced windiness occurred, and precipitation increased as sea surface temperatures began to rise in the Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

OSL ages of well-sorted, quartz sand ranges from 31 to 24 ka from within well-developed podzol soil profiles within a metre of the surface. The source of this sand appears to be from the east off the inner continental shelf during a period just prior to the maximum of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, Marine Isotope Stage 2) when sea-level was approximately 70-90 m below present level. During a later phase of the LGM, there is evidence from other coastal sites in central NSW and Gippsland, Victoria, that the dominant wind was from the west consistent with evidence from arid and semiarid Australia. Dune orientations in northern NSW into Queensland and other evidence at this time appear to reflect winds from the southeast quadrant. This study highlights the existence of a potential pivot area in dominant wind direction during the LGM between sustained westerly flow in southern area including Victoria and northeast Tasmania and southeast flow of northern NSW into Queensland. In central NSW, the circulation switched from easterly in Stage 2 to westerly as the glacial stage intensified in the LGM sometime after ca 25 ka.",2023-03-26 14:45:57.798 +0200,

The results demonstrate continuity of treeless conditions, which probably persisted from the Pleistocene throughout the Holocene, up to the present day. Some changes to the structure of the grassland were observed, especially over the past 200 years. Analysis of carbonized particles showed that fires had been infrequent over the period examined. It seems that this area, close to the altitudinal tree limit, has remained a natural grassland, and the hypothesis of Jackson (1973), that unreliable summer conditions may be a major factor in maintaining open conditions, is supported.

Thomas:2001review,"There is now a wide agreement that temperature depression in the humid tropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was at least 5°C. Most estimates of precipitation reduction at the LGM range from 25-30% to 50-65%, based on proxy data, but the recent CCM1 model envisages only around 12%. Dates obtained from river sediments indicate major changes to fluvial activity in the late Quaternary. Isotope Zone 3 sediments (58-28 ka BP) are widespread and possibly indicate cooler conditions. Post-28 ka BP, and certainly post-21 ka BP, river regimes altered radically towards fan building, braiding or major reduction in all activity. This paper reports on fan formation in NE Queensland between 26 and 14 ka BP and reviews evidence for comparable changes in humid tropical areas of S America, W Africa and SE Asia, including records of Holocene sedimentation. Within a global rhythm of major changes to river regimes in the humid tropics during the late Quaternary, it is now possible to detect regional variations in stream response to climatic change. At the LGM, reductions in stream power may have led to fan formation in NE Queensland, while vegetation changes may have contributed to increased sediment loads and braiding in some forest marginal areas. But, in W Africa, greater aridity may have been responsible for enfeebled streams leaving few records. Channel cutting, then deposition of coarse sediment in braided rivers marked the transition to the early Holocene in W Africa, and fans became entrenched in NE Queensland. This regime persisted until forest recovery was complete by 9.5-8.5 ka BP, when widespread overbank deposition occurred and a change towards meandering channels took place widely across the humid tropical zone, followed by several cut-and-fill episodes in the middle and late Holocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Thomas:2007response,"Samples of alluvial and colluvial deposits from the coastal plain and coastal valleys north and south of Cairns (17S) have been dated using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) protocols, with additional thermoluminescence (TL) and Radiocarbon assays. Coarse fanglomerates from elevated coastal terraces date back to 81 ka, but most are clustered in oxygen isotope stage three (OIS3, 64–28 ka), indicating high-energy conditions during this period. Extensive fans and terraces of finer calibre sediments are widely represented grading from coarse gravels and cobbles in proximal zones fine sand and silt in distal areas. Dates show that vertical accumulation of 10–15 m of sediment occurred between ∼28 and 14 ka (OIS2), after which the fans were dissected and Holocene deposits become fragmentary. A number of deposits indicating hillslope instability were successfully dated and these fall mainly into OIS3 and post 12 ka. These results are interpreted as catchment responses to Late Pleistocene climate and vegetation changes, documented elsewhere from local pollen and ocean drilling sites.

Palynomorphs, which were isolated from sediment core samples, were collected at approximately 0.5-m intervals using a strong acid and oxidant (MD-50)/non-oxidant (MV-41, MV-46) procedure. Radiocarbon (14C) stable isotope geochronology, magnetic susceptibility, stable isotope analysis (MD-50 only; Oxygen-18 [18O] and Carbon-13 [13C]), and clay mineral maturity analysis were also completed for each core. Palynological data indicate that climatic conditions at sea level have remained warm, wet, and stable for the past 14.5 kyr with sea surface temperatures in the GoP above 14 °C. Potential decreases in vegetative cover marked the Younger Dryas interval (12.5--11.5 kyr BP), as indicated by reduced pollen and spore recovery. The end of the latest marine transgression (and the subsequent return to eustatic sea level highstand) is clearly delineated by increases in marine palynomorph recovery and decreases in mangrove pollen at approximately 5 kyr BP. An increase in seasonality and potential El Niño Southern Oscillation variability is observed in MD-50's oxygen isotope results at ∼5 kyr BP. This is not supported by the palynomorph record, likely because of the sampling interval and dilution by tropical pollen flora, which indicates stable climatic conditions throughout the last 14.5 kyr. Sediment transport pathways in the GoP remained fairly constant throughout the time interval, which is supported by the lack of major changes in palynomorph assemblage composition.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Using a multi-proxy framework, including pollen and charcoal analyses, high-resolution geochemistry, and ancient microbial community composition, supported by high-resolution 210Pb and AMS 14C dating, we investigated local and regional ecological and environmental changes occurring in response to changes in temperature. We find the region experienced a general warming trend over the last 3500 years,with a pronounced climate anomaly occurring between 1000 and 1600 cal yrs. BP. Shifts in vegetation took place during this warm period, characterised by a decline in alpine species and an increase in open woodland taxa which co-occurred with an increase in regional fire activity. Given the narrow altitudinal band of Australian alpine vegetation, any future warming has the potential to result in the extinction of alpine species, including several endemic to the area, as treelines are driven to higher elevations.

The isotopic Th/U and Pa/U ratios indicate that some minor uranium mobilization may have occurred in the past. Taking such effects into account, the best age estimate for the human skeleton is obtained through the combination of U-series and ESR analyses yielding 62,000±6000 years. This age is in close agreement with OSL age estimates on the sediment into which the skeleton was buried of 61,000±2000 years. Furthermore, we obtained a U-series age of 81,000±21,000 years for the calcitic matrix that was precipitated on the bones after burial. All age results are considerably older than the previously assumed age of LM3 and demonstrate the necessity for directly dating hominid remains. We conclude that the Lake Mungo 3 burial documents the earliest known human presence on the Australian continent.

Isotope ratios in blood overlapped most strongly with those in invertebrate prey, and varied much less between seasons than did those in most dietary items, suggesting that the assimilated diet of long-nosed bandicoots is dominated by invertebrates throughout the year. Invertebrate remains dominated collected faeces in both seasons, even though the availability of invertebrate prey was higher in summer.

As a result of its economic importance, land use change and river regulation have resulted in ecological degradation of the river and associated river wetlands (known throughout Australia as 'billabongs'). Palaeolimnology can provide otherwise unobtainable information about the relative impacts of stressors and identify 'refuges' from such impacts. We examine an approximately 1800 year history of water quality and vegetation at Junction Park Billabong, on the Murray River approximately 25 km upstream of the Murrumbidgee River confluence. Throughout this period the billabong has maintained a strong connection to the Murray River. Planktonic Aulacoseira granulata has been the dominant diatom in the Murray River, while surrounding vegetation has been dominated by open eucalpyt woodland. Around 500 years before present (BP), there was an increase in effective rainfall as indicated by a decline in Chenopodioideae (Amaranthaceae: saltbush) and an increase in Callitris (native pine) pollen. At the same time, there was an expansion in wetland submerged aquatic macrophytes, as evidenced through increases in the relative abundance of the epiphytic diatom, Cocconeis placentula and sediment organic matter. European settlement resulted in declines in aquatic macrophytes and nutrient enrichment but minimal increases in diatom-inferred salinity. There was relatively little post-settlement change in both the diatom stratigraphy and inferred water quality from Junction Park Billabong which contrasts somewhat with that observed in floodplain water bodies both upstream and downstream of Junction Park.

Contemporary denudation rates average several times lower than the long‐term average (5·5 ± 4 mm kyr−1 versus 21·5 ± 7 mm kyr−1). Erosion of sediment following wildfires accounts for only a small proportion (5\%) of the contemporary rate. Most post‐fire sediment is stored on the lower slopes and valley floor, with the amount transported to the river network dependent on rainfall–run‐off conditions within the first few years following the fire. Historical catastrophic floods account for a much larger proportion (35\%) of the contemporary erosion rate, and highlight the importance of these events in reworking stored material. Evidence for palaeofloods much larger than those experienced over the past 200 years suggests even greater sediment export potential. Mass movement on hillslopes along valleys incised into softer lithology appears to be a dominant erosion process that supplies substantial volumes of material to the valley floor. It is possible that a combination of infrequent mass movement events and high fluvial discharge could account for a significant proportion of the discrepancy between the contemporary and long‐term denudation rates.

Tooth:1997plains,"This thesis is a study of ephemeral drainage systems on the extensive, low-relief Northern Plains in the Alice Springs region of central Australia. Comparison of the Sandover, Bundey and Woodforde Rivers (catchment areas of approximately 10 600, 11 000 and 550 km', respectively) reveals variations in channel morphology, estimated flow conditions and sedimentary characteristics. In the middle reaches of the Sandover catchment, bedloads consist of medium to coarse sands and channels are mainly singlethread. By contrast, in the Bundey and Woodforde catchments, bedloads consist of coarse sands and granules and many reaches are anabranched, with channels separated by narrow, linear, vegetated ridges or broad islands. Anabranching is related to tributary drainage, for ridges and islands form in association with tributary junctions as a result of various processes, including accretion in the lee of in-channel vegetation, by floodplain scour and by the formation of defeiTed-junction tributaries.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Tooth:2008magela,"Many anabranching rivers are characterized by dynamic interactions between fluvial processes and riparian vegetation, but uncertainties surround the processes and time scales of anabranch development. We use geomorphological investigations and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to determine spatial and temporal trends in the development of anabranching along a 6.5-km-long reach of Magela Creek in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. Many trees and shrubs that survive the wet-season floods establish on the sandy beds and lower banks, such that anabranches divide and rejoin around numerous ridges and islands that are formed mainly by accretion in the lee of in-channel vegetation and, less commonly, by excision from formerly continuous island or flood plain surfaces. Once ridges and islands form, colonizing vegetation maintains their stability by increasing sediment cohesion and decreasing flow erosivity. Over the Holocene, Magela Creek has vertically aggraded and extended in length by delta progradation into Madjinbardi Billabong, resulting in a time sequence of anabranches and associated ridges and islands from older (upstream) to younger (downstream). OSL ages for islands in the upstream and middle reaches are ca. 1.6 ka and older, and the narrow, deep anabranches (width/depth [w/d] typically ~10-30) have few in-channel obstructions. Farther downstream, island OSL ages are ca. 0.7 ka and younger, anabranches tend to be wider and shallower (w/d >30) with more obstructions, and splays and locally scoured island and floodplain surfaces are more common. Based on these findings, previous flow and sediment-transport measurements, and theoretical analyses, we posit that there is a decline in anabranch efficiency from an upstream equilibrium system in mass-flux balance to a downstream disequilibrium system characterized by bed aggradation and localized island and floodplain erosion. In the downstream reaches, inefficient (high w/d and obstructed) anabranches do not persist because they either aggrade and are abandoned, or they are subdivided into more efficient (lower w/d and less obstructed) anabranches as a result of the interactions between in-channel vegetation growth and ridge and island accretion or local excision. Consequently, a more efficient anabranching system gradually develops with characteristics similar to those in the upstream reaches. This enhances downstream sediment transfer, which enables ongoing delta progradation and provides fresh sediment surfaces for vegetation to colonize and initiate new anabranches. The OSL ages from Magela Creek demonstrate that a recognizable but relatively inefficient anabranching system can develop within a few centuries, while adjustment to a more efficient system occurs over a few millennia.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Torgersen:1988carpentaria,"Quaternary variations in the level of the sea have exposed the shallow (<70 m) Gulf of Carpentaria (Australia) a number of times during the last glacial. Sedimentary, chemical and palynological analyses of cores from the Gulf are presented and interpreted to describe the palaeoenvironmental sequence of the Carpentaria Basin over the last <40 kyr. The results show an early desiccation followed by the continuous presence of a large (>29,000 km2) but shallow (maximum depth <10 m) fresh-to-brackish Lake Carpentaria from {35 kyr to 12 kyr. Runoff/evaporation ratios were held at about half the present ratio. The environments of the Basin are shown to have been influenced by the level of the sea, Quaternary climatic/monsoonal variations and the tectonic diversion of the Fly River. Palynological analyses indicate a continued savannah-like environment in the Basin with few floristic introductions during the last kyr. The pollen assemblages closely resemble the black soil plains presently found along the southern Gulf.

One of the major aims of that project was to test theories for the origin of Lapita pottery by searching for precursors in the Bismarck Archipelago.

Torrence:2000volcanic,"An evaluation of the relationship between culture change and the history of volcanic activity from the Witori and Dakataua volcanoes in West New Britain province, Papua New Guinea, demonstrates the importance of studies focusing on long time spans to an understanding of cultural adaptation to volcanic disasters. Using a chronostratigraphy based on several techniques for matching tephras, the cultural responses to five volcanic events are compared and contrasted between the Willaumez Peninsula and Yombon, areas whose environment and proximity to the volcanoes vary significantly. Archaeological analyses of material show that human groups did not immediately adjust to the effects of the most severe volcanic events but abandoned both regions. In contrast, adaptation on a long-term basis may be indicated by the occurrence of a punctuated trend in lithic technology iferred to reflect a decrease in mobility and an increase in the intensification of subsistence practices. This pattern, combined with limited radiocarbon dating, suggests that the length of abandonment decreased after each eruption, probably because of chnges in social organization and subsistence practices. The paper demonstrates the value of collaboration between archaeology and geology in the study of long-term human responses to natural hazards.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Torrence:2004pleistocene,"The geological and archaeological signatures at the site of Kupona na Dari on the Willaumez Peninsula, West New Britain provide important new data about human colonisation of the Bismarck Archipelago. Analyses of the stratigraphy and weathering of paleosols and manuports, when combined with fission track, radiocarbon, and luminescence dating, indicate that the site was first occupied at about 35–45,000 years ago. During the whole period of occupation, people were exposed to a series of volcanic events which varied in terms of their potential impacts on the local environment. A PIXE-PIGME characterisation study of the obsidian artefacts at the site demonstrates that from the earliest period stone resources were acquired from outcrops located across a relatively large region. When compared with Early-Middle Holocene assemblages from nearby localities, the Pleistocene stone tool technology differs in only a few minor respects. From this analysis we infer that groups were mobile in both periods, but slightly different strategies for the procurement and maintenance of the stone tools were required for the more extensive ranges exploited during the Pleistocene. The inter-disciplinary study of Kupona na Dari concludes that colonisation comprised a long term process of settling into this volcanically active environment. Due to variability in the environments that people encountered, the pattern of colonisation may not have been similar across the entire Bismarck Archipelago.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Tranel:2015teton,"Short-term geomorphic processes (fluvial, glacial, and hillslope erosion) and long-term exhumation control transient alpine landscapes. Long-term measurements of exhumation are not sufficient to capture the processes driving transient responses associated with short-term climatic oscillations, because of high variability of individual processes across space and time. This study compares the efficacy of different erosional agents to assess the importance of variability in tectonically active landscapes responding to fluctuations in Quaternary climate. We focus on the Teton Range, where erosional mechanisms include hillslope, glacial, and fluvial processes. Erosion rates were quantified using sediment accumulation and cosmogenic dating (bedrock and stream sediments). Results show that rates of erosion are highly variable, with average short-term rockfall rates (0.8 mm/y) occurring faster than either apparent basin-averaged (0.2 mm/y) and long-term ridge erosion rates (0.02 mm/y). Examining erosion rates separately also demonstrates the coupling between glacial, fluvial, and hillslope processes. Apparent basin-averaged erosion rates amalgamate valley wall and ridge erosion with stream and glacial rates. Climate oscillations drive the short-term response of a single erosional process (e.g., rockfalls or other mass wasting) that may enhance or limit the erosional efficiency of other processes (glacial or fluvial). While the Teton landscape may approach long-term equilibrium, stochastic processes and rapid response to short-term climate change actively perpetuate the transient ruggedness of the topography.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Trodahl:2011masters,"Lake Wairarapa is a highly modified lacustrine system at the southern end of the North Island, New Zealand. Not only is it situated in a region that is affected by catchment altering natural phenomena such as earthquakes, storms and fire, but both the catchment and hydrology of the lake have also been significantly altered by humans. Polynesian settlers arrived in the area approximately 700BP and proceeded to deforest the lowlands. European settlers began arriving from 1844AD onwards, completing deforestation of the lowlands and Eastern Uplands. In 1964 the Lower Wairarapa Valley Development Scheme was commissioned in an effort to alleviate flooding. This scheme significantly altered the hydrological regime of the lake. Interest in the condition of the lake and associated wetlands, and the realization that it has important recreational, cultural and ecological value, began to develop in the 1990's. This has led to a desire to see the lake restored to a more natural condition while still maintaining its flood protection capabilities. However, the lake has only been monitored over the last several decades. Any evidence of the lakes condition prior to this time is anecdotal and little is known of its natural tendencies and functions. This research has investigated and quantified morphological changes to Lake Wairarapa at the decadal and millenial scale using a combination of aerial photograph analysis, bathymetric survey comparison and lakebed core analysis. Study at these diverse scales has allowed the observed changes to be related to human environmental modification, while also being juxtaposed against natural trajectories of change. It is hoped that this can inform lake management and restoration efforts and provide a benchmark for measuring future changes to the lake, while also addressing wider issues concerning natural versus anthropogenic landscape change at the local and regional scale. The results of this project suggest that the lake has been steadily infilling over the last 6000BP -- particularly along the eastern shore. For the two decades after significant hydrological changes to the lake associated with the Lower Wairarapa Valley Development Scheme, the rate of infilling on the eastern shore increased more than tenfold. However, this was accompanied by deepening in other parts of the lake. Today infilling along the eastern shore appears to have returned to natural rates and overall the lake in 2010 is only slightly smaller in volume than in 1975. Longer term anthropogenic influence on the lake and catchment was also evident. In particular Polynesian settlement and subsequent deforestation by fire was apparent in the lakebed cores. This result not only addresses the immediate issue of anthropogenic influence on this particular lacustrine system, but also informs the debate surrounding the dating of Polynesian arrival in New Zealand.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Pollen of Nothofagus is present throughout, with Nothofagidites emarcidus the most common form . Myrtaceous pollen is abundant: most types are referable to closed forest genera such as Syzygium, Acmena and Tristania, although a significant component of Eucalyptus type pollen is present. Podocarpaceae are common, and include types comparable to the extant Podocarpus, Dacrycarpus, Phyllocladus, Microcachrys and Dacrydium. Araucariaceae, probably as Araucaria, locally reaches high frequencies. Casuarinaceae is consistently present, and Cyperaceae and Poaceae at some levels reach frequencies in excess of 10 per cent. A group of pollen and spores that were first recorded from Tertiary strata in the modern tropics is present, although in low numbers; these include Polypodiisporites usmensis, Margocolporites vanwijhei, and a form similar to Perfotricolpites digitatus. The site provides good fossil records for a number of extant Australian taxa - Acacia pollen (as Acaciapollenites myriosporites) is present from the late Oligocene, and Gyrostemonaceae pollen was recorded from the same interval - and also the first fossil record in Australia for pollen of Utricularia (as Polycolpites sp.) and Gardenia (as Triporotetradites sp.). There is clear evidence too of diversity within the Cyperaceae by the late Oligocene. Recycled Permian and early Cretaceous spores and pollen are most common in the upper part of the Geera Clay. Dinoflagellate cysts occur throughout the section. The assemblages are dominated by the Spiniferites ramosus complex, with Hystrichokolpoma rigaudae, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium centrocarpum, and Systematophora placacantha the most common of the other components. There is a general similarity to coeval assemblages from Europe and elsewhere, but one major difference is the absence of peridinioid forms such as Deflandrea, Wetzeliella sensu lato, and Palaeocystodinium.

Turney:2001lynchs,"Lynch's Crater preserves a continuous, high-resolution record of environmental changes in north Queensland. This record suggests a marked increase in burning that appears to be independent of any known major climatic boundaries. This increase is accompanied, or closely followed, by the virtually complete replacement of rainforest by sclerophyll vegetation. The absence of any major climatic shift associated with this increase in fire frequency therefore has been interpreted as a result of early human impact in the area. The age for this increase in burning, on the basis of conventional radiocarbon dating, was previously thought to be approximately 38 000 14C yr BP, supporting the traditional model for human arrival in Australia at 40 000 14C yr BP Here we have applied a more rigorous pre-treatment and graphitisation procedure for radiocarbon dating samples from the Lynch's Crater sequence.

Turney:2008megafauna,"Establishing the cause of past extinctions is critical if we are to understand better what might trigger future occurrences and how to prevent them. The mechanisms of continental late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction, however, are still fiercely contested. Potential factors contributing to their demise include climatic change, human impact, or some combination. On the Australian mainland, 90% of the megafauna became extinct by ~46 thousand years (ka) ago, soon after the first archaeological evidence for human colonization of the continent. Yet, on the neighboring island of Tasmania (which was connected to the mainland when sea levels were lower), megafaunal extinction appears to have taken place before the initial human arrival between 43 and 40 ka, which would seem to exonerate people as a contributing factor in the extirpation of the island megafauna. Age estimates for the last megafauna, however, are poorly constrained. Here, we show, by direct dating of fossil remains and their associated sediments, that some Tasmanian megafauna survived until at least 41 ka (i.e., after their extinction on the Australian mainland) and thus overlapped with humans. Furthermore, a vegetation record for Tasmania spanning the last 130 ka shows that no significant regional climatic or environmental change occurred between 43 and 37 ka, when a land bridge existed between Tasmania and the mainland. Our results are consistent with a model of human-induced extinction for the Tasmanian megafauna, most probably driven by hunting, and they reaffirm the value of islands adjacent to continental landmasses as tests of competing hypotheses for late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Ulm:1996prehistory,"In this paper we present an overview of the radiocarbon chronology of pre-European Aboriginal occupation of southeast Queensland. Analysis of these data provides the basis for evaluating cultural chronologies proposed for southeast Queensland which emphasise time-lags between sea-level stabilisation and permanent occupation of the coast and late prehistoric structural change in settlement and subsistence strategies linked to intensifying regional social alliance networks. This synthesis of the radiocarbon chronology demonstrates that significant increases in the number of occupied sites and the rate of site establishment does not occur until after 1,200 cal BP, and is restricted to the coastal strip. While sea-level change may have significantly influenced the representation of earlier sites, the pattern over the last 1,000 years cannot be explained solely in terms of differential preservation due to geomorphological processes. While these results indicate significant structural change in the archaeological record of southeast Queensland in the late Holocene, the nature of that change requires closer examination through further detailed studies of local and regional patterns.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Ulm:2002reservoir,"As a component of archaeological investigations on the central Queensland coast, a series of five marine shell specimens live-collected between A.D. 1904 and A.D. 1929 and 11 shell/charcoal paired samples from archaeological contexts were radiocarbon dated to determine local ΔR values. The object of the study was to assess the potential influence of localized variation in marine reservoir effect in accurately determining the age of marine and estuarine shell from archaeological deposits in the area. Results indicate that the routinely applied ΔR value of −5 ± 35 for northeast Australia is erroneously calculated. The determined values suggest a minor revision to Reimer and Reimer's (2000) recommended value for northeast Australia from ΔR = +11 ± 5 to +12 ± 7, and specifically for central Queensland to ΔR = +10 ± 7, for near-shore open marine environments. In contrast, data obtained from estuarine shell/charcoal pairs demonstrate a general lack of consistency, suggesting estuary-specific patterns of variation in terrestrial carbon input and exchange with the open ocean. Preliminary data indicate that in some estuaries, at some time periods, a ΔR value of more than −155 ± 55 may be appropriate. In estuarine contexts in central Queensland, a localized estuary-specific correction factor is recommended to account for geographical and temporal variation in 14C activity. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Human foraging pressure was assessed through reconstructions of population age structure across time, highlighting the importance of determining size-at-age habitat preferences and species behaviour patterns when assessing long-term anthropogenic impacts on shellfish populations. Results show no evidence for resource depression across the late Holocene which is broadly in keeping with previous findings at other locales on the Great Barrier Reef, but contrary to expectations of resource intensification models. We conclude that the rich and abundant resources of reef flat environments were resilient to relatively low intensity and likely episodic Indigenous foraging.

Urwin:2018thesis,"Orokolo Bay, located in the Gulf of Papua (Papua New Guinea), is a place well known to anthropology for its elaborate social and ceremonial life. Early colonial observers were struck by the large villages and vast longhouse structures that sustained decade-spanning ceremonies and annual long-distance exchanges (called hiri) in which seafaring traders from today’s Port Moresby region would bring ceramic pots and shell valuables for sago palm (Metroxlyon sagu) starch and hulls for their ships. However, the history of large coastal trading communities in the Gulf of Papua is poorly understood. This thesis interweaves archaeological and ethnographic approaches to examine how the ancestral village of Popo, in Orokolo Bay, was built through time, and how local villagers today make sense of its construction through engaged practices of remembering. In local oral traditions, Popo is known as the ‘first‘ village: it was composed of several estates each built by a different ‘tribe‘. Here Popo’s construction is investigated archaeologically by analysing cultural materials and chronologies from eight excavations. These excavations took place in 2015 within six of Popo’s estates, and at two settlements which bookend the occupation of Popo in oral traditions. Local knowledges and memories of ancestral places including Popo were examined through seven formal interviews and through informal cross-cultural interactions. Bayesian statistical analysis of 35 radiocarbon dates demonstrates phased construction of Popo’s estates over the course of around 500 years within the period 680-140 cal. BP. ...

These central places sustained long-distance exchange and decade-spanning ceremonial cycles. Besides ethnohistoric records, little is known of the villages’ antiquity, spatiality, or development. Here we combine oral traditional and 14C chronological evidence to investigate the spatial history of two ancestral village sites in Orokolo Bay: Popo and Mirimua Mapoe. A Bayesian model composed of 35 14C assays from seven excavations, alongside the oral traditional accounts, demonstrates that people lived at Popo from 765–575 cal BP until 220–40 cal BP, at which time they moved southwards to Mirimua Mapoe. The village of Popo spanned ca. 34 ha and was composed of various estates, each occupied by a different tribe. Through time, the inhabitants of Popo transformed (e.g., expanded, contracted, and shifted) the village to manage social and ceremonial priorities, long-distance exchange opportunities and changing marine environments. Ours is a crucial case study of how oral traditional ways of understanding the past interrelate with the information generated by Bayesian 14C analyses.

Urwin:2023regional,"According to written histories, trepang fishers from Island Southeast Asia ('Makassans') frequented coastal northern Australia from c.1750 to 1907 CE.

Yet archaeological radiocarbon chronologies for the Southeast Asian trepang industry and earlier voyaging encounters are few and the dates have never been comprehensively reviewed. Only one Arnhem Land trepang fishery site has been dated extensively, and others have produced unusually old dates of c.1200--1500 CE. The Groote Eylandt rockshelter of Dadirrigka yielded an enigmatic sherd of friable earthenware above a radiocarbon date of c.1100 CE.

Val:2018andes,"Landscape evolution modeling and global compilations of exhumation data indicate that a wetter climate, mainly through orographic rainfall, can govern the spatial distribution of erosion rates and crustal strain across an orogenic wedge. However, detecting this link is not straightforward since these relationships can be modulated by tectonic forcing and/or obscured by heavy-tailed frequencies of catchment discharge. This study combines new and published along-strike average rates of catchment erosion constrained by 10Be and river-gauge data in the Central Andes between 28°S and 36°S. These data reveal a nearly identical latitudinal pattern in erosion rates on both sides of the range, reaching a maximum of 0.27 mm/a near 34°S. Collectively, data on topographic and fluvial relief, variability of rainfall and discharge, and crustal seismicity suggest that the along-strike pattern of erosion rates in the southern Central Andes is largely independent of climate, but closely relates to the N–S distribution of shallow crustal seismicity and diachronous surface uplift. The consistently high erosion rates on either side of the orogen near 34°S imply that climate plays a secondary role in the mass flux through an orogenic wedge where the perturbation to base level is similar on both sides.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Vanacker:2007escarpment,"Escarpments are prominent morphological features along high-elevation passive margins. Recent studies integrating geomorphology, thermochronology, and cosmogenic nuclide-based denudation rate estimates suggest a rapid phase of denudation immediately after the earliest stages of seafloor spreading, and subsequent slow denudation rates since. To constrain the geomorphic evolution of passive margins, we have examined the development of the Sri Lankan escarpment. Cosmogenic nuclide data on river sediment along a north–south transect across the southern escarpment reveal that the landscape is eroding ten times more rapidly in the escarpment zone (26 to 71 mm kyr− 1) than in the high-elevation plateau above it and in the lowland plain beneath it (2.6 to 6.2 mm kyr− 1). Unlike these low denudation rate areas, the escarpment denudation is strongly and linearly hill slope-dependent. This shows that denudation and retreat are tightly interlinked within the escarpment, which suggests that the escarpment is evolving by rift-parallel retreat, rather than by escarpment downwearing. Supporting evidence is provided by the morphology of rivers draining the escarpment zone. These have steep bedrock channels which show sharp and prominent knickpoints along their longitudinal profiles. It appears that fluvial processes are driving escarpment retreat, as rivers migrate headwards were they incise into the high-elevation plateau. However, the average catchment-wide denudation rates of the escarpment zone are low compared to the denudation rates that are estimated for constant escarpment retreat since rifting. In common with other escarpments worldwide, causes for this slow down can be tectonic change related to flexural bending of the lithosphere, climate change that would vary the degree of precipitation focused into the escarpment, or the decrease in the contributing catchment area, which would reduce the stream power available for fluvial erosion.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Vanacker:2007vegetation,"Tropical mountain areas may undergo rapid land degradation as demographic growth and intensified agriculture cause more people to migrate to fragile ecosystems. To assess the extent of the resulting damage, an erosion rate benchmark against which changes in erosion can be evaluated is required. Benchmarks reflecting natural erosion rates are usually not provided by conventional sediment fluxes, which are often biased due to modern land use change, and also miss large, episodic events within the measuring period. To overcome this, we combined three independent assessment tools in the southern Ecuadorian Andes, an area that is severely affected by soil erosion. First, denudation rates from cosmogenic nuclides in river sediment average over time periods of 1–100 k.y. and establish a natural benchmark of only 150 ± 100 t km−2 yr−1. Second, we find that land use practices have increased modern sediment yields as derived from reservoir sedimentation rates, which average over periods of 10–100 yr to as much as 15 × 103 t km−2 yr−1. Third, our land cover analysis has shown us that vegetation cover exerts first-order control over present-day erosion rates at the catchment scale. Areas with high vegetation density erode at rates that are characteristically similar to those of the natural benchmark, regardless of whether the type of vegetation is native or anthropogenic. Therefore, our data suggest that even in steep mountain environments sediment fluxes can slow to near their natural benchmark levels with suitable revegetation programs. A set of techniques is now in place to evaluate the effectiveness of erosion mitigation strategies.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Vanacker:2015transient,"Mountain rivers draining tropical regions are known to be great conveyor belts carrying efficiently more than half of the global sediment flux to the oceans. Many tropical mountain areas are located in tectonically active belts where the hillslope and stream channel morphology are rapidly evolving in response to changes in base level. Here, we report basin-wide denudation rates for an east–west transect through the tropical Andes. Hillslope and channel morphology vary systematically from east to west, reflecting the transition from high relief, strongly dissected topography in the escarpment zones into relatively low relief topography in the inter-Andean valley. The spatial pattern of differential denudation rates reflects the transient adjustment of the landscape to rapid river incision following tectonic uplift and river diversion. In the inter-Andean valley, upstream of the wave of incision, slopes and river channels display a relatively smooth, concave-up morphology and denudation rates (time scale of 104–105 a) are consistently low (3 to 200 mm/ka). In contrast, slopes and river channels of rejuvenated basins draining the eastern cordillera are steep to very steep; and the studied drainage basins show a wide range of denudation rate values (60 to 400 mm/ka) that increase systematically with increasing basin mean slope gradient, channel steepness, and channel convexity. Drainage basins that are characterised by strong convexities in their river longitudinal profiles systematically have higher denudation rates. As such, this is one of the first studies that provides field-based evidence of a correlation between channel concavity and basin mean denudation rates, consistent with process-based fluvial incision models.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Vanacker:2020tropical,"Tropical mountain regions are prone to high erosion rates, due to the occurrence of heavy rainfall events and intensely weathered steep terrain. Landslides are a recurrent phenomenon, and often considered as the dominant erosion process on the hillslopes and the main source of sediment. Quantifying the contribution of landslide-derived sediment to the overall sediment load remains a challenge. In this study, we derived catchment-average erosion rates from sediment gauging data and cosmogenic radionuclides (CRN), and examined their reliability and validity for constraining sediment yields in tectonically active regions. Then, we analysed the relationship between catchment-average erosion rates and landslide-derived sediment fluxes. The Pangor catchment, located in the western Andean mountain front, was selected for this study given its exceptionally long time series of hydrometeorological data (1974-2009). When including magnitude-frequency analyses of the sediment yields at the measurement site, the corrected gauging-based sediment yields remain one order of magnitude lower than the CRN-derived erosion rates. The underestimation of catchment-average erosion rates from gauging data points to the difficulty of extrapolating flow frequency and sediment rating data in non-stationary hydrological regimes, and severe undersampling of extreme events. In such conditions, erosion rates derived from cosmogenic radionuclides are a reliable alternative method for the quantification of catchment-average sediment yield. ...

Vance:2003himalaya,"The outward erosional flux is a key factor in the tectonic evolution of mountain belts and there is much debate about the feedbacks between tectonics, erosion and climate. Here we use cosmogenic nuclides (10Be and 26Al) analysed in quartz from river sediments from the Upper Ganges catchment to make the first direct measurements of large-scale erosion rates in a rapidly uplifting mountain belt. The erosion rates are highest in the High Himalaya at 2.7±0.3 mm/yr (1σ errors), fall to 1.2±0.1 mm/yr on the southern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and are 0.8±0.3 to <0.6 mm/yr in the foothills to the south of the high mountains. These relative estimates are corroborated by the Nd isotopic mass balance of the river sediment. Analysis of sediment from an abandoned terrace suggests that similar erosion rates have been maintained for at least the last few thousand years. The data presented here, along with data recently published for European river catchments, demonstrate that a log–linear relationship between relief and erosion rate holds over three orders of magnitude variation in erosion rate and between very different climatic and tectonic regimes. ...

Vandergoes:1997takitimu,"Pollen analysis of a core from a raised bog has provided a late glacial and Holocene vegetation record for the Takitimu Mountains in western Southland, New Zealand. The record shows a change from alpine grassland-shrubland at 12 600 yr BP to a low broadleaf bushland by 9800 yr BP. The bushland was succeeded by tall podocarp forest after 9400 yr BP which was replaced by cool montane mixed temperate forest dominated by Nothofagus menziesii after 4000 yr BP. Since 4000 yr BP, the only major changes in vegetation have been a slow increase in the values of Nothofagus fusca type pollen. An increase in Pteridium together with an increase in charcoal within the last 600 years may record Polynesian burning, and the later appearance of Abies and Pinus, together with an increase in grassland, records European influences. Comparison with other pollen profiles from southern New Zealand shows that many of the changes in vegetation associations are broadly synchronous and may be related directly to climate change. Differences in the timing of some floristic changes may reflect the combined effects of local climates and other local environmental factors, including the proximity of vegetation refugia to individual sites.

Here we present an independently dated terrestrial pollen record from a peat bog on South Island, New Zealand, to investigate global and local factors in Southern Hemisphere climate changes during the last two glacial--interglacial cycles. Our record largely corroborates the Milankovitch model of orbital forcing but also exhibits some differences: in particular, an earlier onset and longer duration of the Last Glacial Maximum. Our results suggest that Southern Hemisphere insolation may have been responsible for these differences in timing.

The Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra, a key isochronous marker, affords a precise stratigraphic link across all three pollen records, while other tie points are provided by key pollen-stratigraphic changes which appear to be synchronous across all three sites. Collectively, the records show three episodes in which grassland, interpreted as indicating mostly cold subalpine to alpine conditions, was prevalent in lowland south Westland, separated by phases dominated by subalpine shrubs and montane-lowland trees, indicating milder interstadial conditions. Dating, expressed as a Bayesian-estimated single 'best' age followed in parentheses by younger/older bounds of the 95 percent confidence modelled age range, indicates that a cold stadial episode, whose onset was marked by replacement of woodland by grassland, occurred between 28,730 (29,390-28,500) and 25,470 (26,090-25,270) cal. yr BP (years before AD, 1950), prior to the deposition of the Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra. Milder interstadial conditions prevailed between 25,470 (26,090-25,270) and 24,400 (24,840-24,120) cal. yr BP and between 22,630 (22,930-22,340) and 21,980 (22,210-21,580) cal. yr BP, separated by a return to cold stadial conditions between 24,400 and 22,630 cal. yr BP. A final episode of grass-dominated vegetation, indicating cold stadial conditions, occurred from 21,980 (22,210-21,580) to 18,490 (18,670-17,950) cal. yr BP. The decline in grass pollen, indicating progressive climate amelioration, was well advanced by 17,370 (17,730-17,110) cal. yr BP, indicating that the onset of the termination in south Westland occurred sometime between ca 18,490 and ca 17,370 cal. yr BP. A similar general pattern of stadials and interstadials is seen, to varying degrees of resolution but generally with lesser chronological control, in many other paleoclimate proxy records from the New Zealand region. This highly resolved chronology of vegetation changes from southwestern New Zealand contributes to the examination of past climate variations in the southwest Pacific region. The stadial and interstadial episodes defined by southWestland pollen records represent notable climate variability during the latter part of the Last Glaciation. Similar climatic patterns recorded farther afield, for example from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, imply that climate variations during the latter part of the Last Glaciation and the transition to the Holocene interglacial were inter-regionally extensive in the Southern Hemisphere and thus important to understand in detail and to place into a global context.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

These new 10Bei-based erosion rates are strongly related to elevation, which appears to control mean annual precipitation and temperature, suggesting that elevation-dependent surface processes influence rates of erosion in northeast Tasmania.

This Province, one of the most remarkable landscapes of the Brazilian Atlantic shield is characterizedby three morphological domains (stepped highland hills, bornhardts and smooth lowlands) generated by a peculiar concurrence of climate and tectonic events during the Cenozoic. River sediments were used to evaluate average denudation rates in catchment areas. The results in the three domains are close to each other. In the highlands the average (6.86±0.48 m. My-1) is close to those of the bornhardts domain (6.13±0.46 m. My-1) and in the lowlands it is slightly lower (5.38±0.53 m. My-1). Considering their standard deviation these values must be considered similar. However the values of denudation rates in highlands and lowlands are lower than those of other similar landscapes from Brazil. This fact can be attributed to the high resistance to weathering, of the Carlos Chagas syenogranite, which has high quartz content. The values of denudation rate for the bornhardts domain, despite being low, suggest that the erosional process of bornhardts exposure is still occurring.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Unfortunately, the Allchar deposit currently sits at a depth of only 120 m below the surface, apparently making the lorandite experiment technically infeasible. We here present 25 erosion rate estimates for the Allchar area using in situ produced cosmogenic 36Cl in carbonates and 10Be in alluvial quartz. The new measurements suggest long-term erosion rates of 100–120 m Ma−1 in the silicate lithologies that are found at the higher elevations of the Majdanksa River valley, and 200–280 m Ma−1 in the underlying marbles and dolomites. These values indicate that the lorandite deposit has spent most of its existence at depths of more than 400 m, sufficient for the neutrinogenic 205Pb component to dominate the muon contribution.

Only one of these coastal sites, an extensive mounded midden on the northwestern littoral of Wamar Island (Figs 6.1–6.3), was excavated. It is located approximately one kilometre from the modern village of Wangil. This paper documents the test pitting and analysis of the Wangil midden. Many of the coastal middens recorded in the Aru group (Chapter 4, this volume) were noted to contain both plain and decorated pottery, and this raised the possibility of characterizing and dating assemblages from the Neolithic through to the historic period. This had been identified as one of the major research aims of the Aru Project (see Chapter 1, this volume; Spriggs 1998). It was clear from the presence of imported ceramics that many of these sometimes extensive coastal middens were quite recent. This was demonstrated in several cases by the presence of glass bottles eroding from the deposits that could be dated to the 18th and 19th centuries, possibly attesting to a colonial-era trade in prized marine commodities such as pearl shell. Previous survey had located midden complexes along the northwestern coastline and at various localities along the central east and southeastern sectors of the island group (see Chapter 4, this volume). Surface scatters of shellfish were less commonly sighted than buried linear and mounded forms, presumably due to the better preservation of the latter due to their greater inherent mass and resistance to the leaching of calcium carbonate in the tropics.",2022-10-09 20:04:07.350 +0200,

Veth:2017barrow,"Archaeological deposits from Boodie Cave on Barrow Island, northwest Australia, reveal some of the oldest evidence for Aboriginal occupation of Australia, as well as illustrating the early use of marine resources by modern peoples outside of Africa. Barrow Island is a large (202 km2) limestone continental island located on the North-West Shelf of Australia, optimally located to sample past use of both the Pleistocene coastline and extensive arid coastal plains. An interdisciplinary team forming the Barrow Island Archaeology Project (BIAP) has addressed questions focusing on the antiquity of occupation of coastal deserts by hunter-gatherers; the use and distribution of marine resources from the coast to the interior; and the productivity of the marine zone with changing sea levels. Boodie Cave is the largest of 20 stratified deposits identified on Barrow Island with 20 m3 of cultural deposits excavated between 2013 and 2015. In this first major synthesis we focus on the dating and sedimentology of Boodie Cave to establish the framework for ongoing analysis of cultural materials. We present new data on these cultural assemblages - including charcoal, faunal remains and lithics - integrated with micromorphology, sedimentary history and dating by four independent laboratories. First occupation occurs between 51.1 and 46.2 ka, overlapping with the earliest dates for occupation of Australia. Marine resources are incorporated into dietary assemblages by 42.5 ka and continue to be transported to the cave through all periods of occupation, despite fluctuating sea levels and dramatic extensions of the coastal plain. The changing quantities of marine fauna through time reflect the varying distance of the cave from the contemporaneous shoreline. The dietary breadth of both arid zone terrestrial fauna and marine species increases after the Last Glacial Maximum and significantly so by the mid-Holocene. The cave is abandoned by 6.8 ka when the island becomes increasingly distant from the mainland coast.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

vonBlanckenburg:2004tropical,"Some of the lowest weathering and erosion rates in any mountain range in the world have been measured using cosmogenic nuclides in the steep, humid, tropical highlands of Sri Lanka. The total preanthropogenic denudation rates were measured in creek sediments and soil samples from unperturbed rain forest sites, bedrock from mountain crests, and bedrock from inselbergs. Denudation rates are in the range of 5–30 t km−2 yr−1 (2–11 mm ky−1). These rates average denudation over the last 50–250 ky. Weathering exports in rivers draining the mountainous Central Highlands show that silicate weathering rates are also low, varying from 5 to 20 t km−2 yr−1 today (2–7 mm ky−1), but they represent a significant fraction of the total denudation. All these observations run contrary to the conventional geomorphologic and geochemical wisdom that would predict rapid erosion for highlands of high relief, temperatures, and precipitation. We speculate that the high relief in Sri Lanka represents the remnant of a geomorphic block that was uplifted during rifting at 130 Ma or even earlier and that was reduced to the interior of the island by rapid receding of escarpments after continental breakup. It is possible that throughout this history, hillslopes, where not exposing bare bedrock, were protected by thick weathered profiles. Such clay‐rich layers would inhibit silicate weathering by shielding bedrock from weathering agents. In the absence of landscape rejuvenation, physical erosion rates are low, and fresh mineral surfaces are not being supplied. The observation that wet, steep, tropical highlands can have low rates of rock weathering and erosion has some potentially profound implications for the long‐term controls of atmospheric CO2 budgets: High temperature and precipitation, which are much invoked though controversial agents for silicate dissolution and CO2 drawdown, become ineffective in promoting weathering in areas that are not tectonically active.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wahome:1995thesis,"This study explores the ceramic sequence of the Admiralty Islands (Manus Province, Papua New Guinea) between 2000 BP and the present, covering both post-Lapita and Late prehistoric periods in Island Melanesia. In the Admiralties, information on these periods comes mainly from surface collections with no reliable chronology. In pursuing the goal of establishing a ceramic sequence for the Admiralties, the current study utilises the potential of attributes, attribute combinations and xeroradiography to cover several aspects of ceramic characterization. Through such studies, a ceramic sequence has been established for the Admiralties for the first time. This sequence is divided into four main periods:(i) Lapita,(ii) Early post-Lapita,(iii) Late post-Lapita and (iv) Late prehistoric periods, which have been compared with the rest of Island Melanesia to address wider questions of Ceramic regional traditions and exchange through time. The strength of this sequence is that the methods used are inexpensive and all the attributes are standard. This means that future researchers in Melanesia can easily seriate their surface ceramic collections to place them within the sequence. Ceramics from sites with unreliable dates, ofte1n the case in the Admiralties and elsewhere, can be cross-dated using this sequence. In dealing with the wider questions of regional ceramic traditions, the thesis confirms the existence of a widely spread ceramic tradition of incised and applied pottery, and clarifies the position of regional variants like Mangaasi within this tradition. This represents an important contribution to Pacific archaeology given the long-standing confusion over the status of incised and applied pottery in the region‘s prehistory.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Walcek:2012argentine,"The timing of uplift of the Precordillera is important for understanding the linkages, if any, between slab dynamics, shortening and topography. The study region (between 32° and 33° S latitude) lies at the southern end of the flat slab, where the subducting Nazca plate is nearly horizontal. South of the study region, subduction occurs at normal subduction angles of around 30° while north of the study region the slab subducts at around 5°. We use the geomorphology of the region to date the initiation of surface uplift and the ensuing landscape adjustment. The topography of the Precordillera of the Argentine Andes consists of both remnants of a low-relief Miocene landscape developed when the region was at a lower elevation, and rapidly eroding fluvial systems that have been dissecting this surface since uplift. This study utilizes 26Al and 10Be concentrations in stream sediment quartz to calculate erosion rates of the Miocene remnant paleo-landscape, as well as incision rates within the actively incising post-uplift fluvial system. The remnant landscape is eroding at < 10 m/My, while the surrounding landscape is eroding an order of magnitude faster, approaching 100 m/My. These values show the transition from a rapidly eroding system adjusting to uplift, to a system where rates of uplift approach those of erosion. We used a locally determined relationship between average upstream slope and erosion rate to model erosion across the landscape. DEM analyses of modern river profiles are used to reconstruct paleo-river profiles, which suggest an average of 1.3 km of uplift. Uplift of the southernmost Argentine Precordillera is constrained to have initiated by ~ 10 Ma, demonstrating that under the arid conditions typical of the southernmost Precordillera, millions of years are needed for a landscape to reach equilibrium.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Wallis:2001carpenters,"Examination of a phytolith assemblage from the archaeological site of Carpenter's Gap 1 provides an hitherto unrecognised source of vegetation history for the tropical savannah region of north western Australia. Two predominant mechanisms contributed to the formation of the phytolith assemblage: firstly, the introduction of phytoliths in plant materials brought in by humans, and, secondly, the introduction of phytoliths contained in faecal pellets deposited by animals. Separating the effects of both mechanisms enables local vegetation patterns, and, by inference, climatic conditions, to be reconstructed. The period ca. 40,000 years BP was probably wetter than today, allowing the southerly expansion of palms beyond their present day distribution. Grassland compositional changes occurred by ca. 33,000 years BP, probably resulting from a combination of lowered rainfall, decreased temperatures and possibly Aboriginal firing activities. A reduction in palm at a similar time, followed by its complete disappearance, in association with the loss of Ulmaceae prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) indicates a continued trend in decreasing water availability. An abundance of Cyperaceae, sponge spicules and diatoms during the LGM, when considered in conjunction with the other evidence, possibly represents altered human behaviour in response to increased aridity.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Walters:1986thesis,"This thesis examines a marine fishery in prehistory. Ethnohistorical records of Aboriginal fishing in the Moreton Bay area and an analysis of excavated fish remains from eight archaeological sites provide for an interpretation of two thousand years of fishery management. In a coastal environment not relatively rich in terrestrial resources, prehistoric subsistence took a maritime focus, with fish being a principal component of the food supply. Vertebrae and other post-cranial remains dominated the archaeological samples. An analysis which concentrated upon cranial skeletal elements would have produced a significantly different picture of catch composition. The study of vertebrae permitted a degree of taphonomic control otherwise unobtainable. All catches were dominated by one or two taxa, and patterns of species abundance took the form of geometric and logseries distributions. The most diverse catches were those from sites adjacent to the dune-island barrier surf beaches. Fishers were able to specialize to a significantly greater degree in mangrove estuarine habitats. Fish were significantly larger in catches from the eastern bay than from the west. This pattern follows from the life cycle characteristics of relevant populations, whereby juveniles form a larger proportion of samples taken from mangrove-estuarine areas in the western bay. The fishery operated inshore throughout its history. Seasonality assessment was undertaken by examination of growth rings on skeletal elements of mullet and whiting. Samples of vertebrae of these taxa from two sites. Sandstone Point and Toulkerrie, were amenable to determination of season of death. A significant seasonal emphasis was demonstrated, corresponding to periods of boom prey abundance. But a significant proportion of the catch was also taken in off-peak times. This analysis suggested that during the last thousand years at least, fish were caught throughout the year. This implied sedentary occupation in the bay area during the most recent millennium. The suite of fishing material culture was diverse. The data reflect no one-to-one correlation between catches and particular items of fishing gear. Strategies correlated with fish behaviour and ecology to incorporate multiple methods of fish catching at given times and places. The absence of fish hooks throughout the history of the fishery cannot adequately be explained by recourse to environmental phenomena. The pattern of hook and line fishing in eastern Australia is interpreted in terras of the social relations of production prevailing in various regions. A case is made for the removal of the strict distinction between resources and subsistence technology as factors determining demographic parameters. The pattern of fishing strategies is accounted for in large part as a series of adaptive responses to environmental heterogeneity. However, establishment of the fishery late in the Holocene, together with the deployment of material culture items and growth in fish production through time, suggests that adaptation cannot account for all aspects of fishery practice. The dynamics of social and cultural variables cannot be discounted as deterministic with regard to these phenomena.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Wang:2017wenchuan,"Quantifying the removal of co‐seismic landslide material after a large‐magnitude earthquake is central to our understanding of geomorphic recovery from seismic events and the topographic evolution of tectonically active mountain ranges. In order to gain more insight into the fluvial erosion response to co‐seismic landslides, we focus on the sediment fluxes of rivers flowing through the rupture zone of the 2008 M w 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake in the Longmen Shan of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Over the post‐seismic period of 2008–2013, we annually collected river sediment samples (0.25–1 mm) at 19 locations and measured the concentration of cosmogenic 10Be in quartz. When compared with published pre‐earthquake data, the 10Be concentrations declined dramatically after the earthquake at all sampling sites, but with significant spatial differences in the amplitude of this decrease, and were starting to increase toward pre‐earthquake level in several basins over the 5‐year survey. Our analysis shows that the amplitude of 10Be decrease is controlled by the amount of landslides directly connected to the river network. Calculations based on 10Be mixing budgets indicate that the sediment flux of the 0.25–1 mm size fraction increased up to sixfold following the Wenchuan earthquake. Our results also suggest that fluvial erosion became supply limited shortly after the earthquake, and predict that it could take a few years to several decades for fluvial sediment fluxes to go back to pre‐earthquake characteristics, depending on catchment properties. We also estimate that it will take at least decades and possibly up to thousands of years to remove the co‐seismic landslide materials from the catchments in the Longmen Shan.

Wang:2021conjugate,"A great escarpment at a passive margin is the mountainous area that separates the low-relief high plateau and the low-relief but low-lying coastal plain. River incision models, such as the stream- power incision model, are often used to quantify the relationship between erosion rates and topographic metrics. Stream-power incision models predict higher erosion rates for steeper river reaches, while accounting for vertical rock motion due to uplift or denudation. Escarpment rivers are steep compared to rivers from active-tectonic regions, suggesting high erosion rates on the escarpment. But slow erosion rates interpreted from cosmogenic nuclide concentrations contradict the morphology-inferred denudation pattern. ...

This peculiar configuration is a source of controversy and questions about the topographic evolution and dynamics of this orogenic plateau margin. Investigating the variations in surface denudation over different spatial and temporal scales is important for a better understanding of topographic evolution, but there is still a lack of erosion-rate data averaged over millennial timescales along the frontal range of the Longmen Shan, especially in its southern part.

Ward:2003keep,"This geoarchaeological study aims to establish the geomorphic context of Aboriginal cultural landscapes and archaeological sites in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, over the Late Quaternary. The geomorphic focus of the thesis is concentrated on the sand sheets, which occur at the base of the sandstone escarpments. Sample locations include the occupation (rockshelter and sand sheet) sites of Goorurarmum, Jinmium and Karlinga, and non-occupation(creek) sites at Karlinga and Sandy Creek Gorge. The thesis presents five interrelated studies, including (i) an assessment of the theoretical relevance of geoarchaeology in northern Australia; and three studies at different timescales, evaluating (ii) long-term landscape processes over timescales of millenia using in situ osmogenic dating, (iii) sedimentary processes over timescales of centuries to millenia using luminescence dating, and sedimentary processes over decadal timescales. A fifth study integrates the results of the above four studies with existing archaeological data. Measurement of in-situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations from the local escarpment bedrock has revealed denudation rates of 4 - 7 mm.ka-1 over 103 - 105 year timescales, consistent with similar studies in other parts of semi-arid Australia. Calculated bedrock denudation rates were used to model burial profiles up to 6 m deep from the Jinmium sand sheet. Measured concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in two profiles, provided vertical accretion rates of ~10 - 20 mm.ka-1 over the past few hundred thousand years. Grain size, micromorphology, mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that the sand-sheet sediments are locally sourced. The rock-shelter sediments have higher relative concentrations of CaO, P205 and greater LOI, than the surrounding sand-sheet sediments, reflecting higher levels of charcoal, guano and organic matter. Post-depositional reddening of the sediments reflects groundwater variation rather than any proxy for depositional age. A total of 33 thermoluminescence (TL) and 15 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from the rock-shelters, sand sheets and creek embankments. U- and Th-series analyses indicate relative equilibrium, with slightly higher dose rates (3.0 ± 0.83 Gy.ky-1) for mottled sediments than elsewhere (1.3 ± 0.29 Gy.ky-1). Foreshortened TL plateaux in some sand sheet sediments at Goorurarmum and Jinmium, and stepped TL plateaux in the sediments alongside Sandy Creek are indicative of episodic rapid deposition events. Basal OSL ages for the Goorurarumum rock shelter and adjacent sand sheet excavation are 0.3 ± 0.07 ky BP and 14.3 ± 0.4 ky BP respectively, and near-basal OSL ages for the Karlinga rock shelter and more distant sand sheet",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Ward:2005keep,"This paper evaluates the Late Quaternary chronostratigraphic context of archaeological sites in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, Australia. Cosmogenic dating, luminescence dating and sediment characterisation reveal sedimentary processes commencing from erosion of the escarpment and plateaux source through temporary storage in sand sheets, to final deposition in alluvial floodplains. Erosion of the sandstone plateaux (∼5mmka−1) and escarpment faces (probably ∼50–100mmka−1) provide the main sediment source for the adjacent sand sheets which have evolved over the past 100,000 years as the product of ongoing cycles of accumulation and denudation. The rate of sediment accumulation is lowest near the escarpments on the low-energy sediment-limited sand sheets (<100mmka−1) and greatest near the main streams (>400mmka−1) that have more numerous sediment sources. Collectively, luminescence ages indicate an apparent increase in sediment accumulation rate in the sand sheets from ∼100mmka−1 in the late Pleistocene to over 200mmka−1 in the Holocene. This most likely reflects enhanced monsoonal activity following postglacial marine transgression. Palaeosol horizons in the creek profile distinguished by sediment mottling mark potentially significant palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes during the Quaternary.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Ward:2006keep,"This paper compares archaeological evidence of Aboriginal occupation inside rock shelters and outside in adjacent sand sheets, focusing on two locations in the Keep-River region, northwestern Australia. Luminescence and radiocarbon dating reveal that occupation sequences inside rock shelters are generally younger ( < 10,000 yr B.P.) than outside ( < 18,000 yr B.P.). Differences in occupation chronology and artifact assemblages inside and outside rock shelters result from depositional and postdepositional processes and shifts in site function. An increase in regional sedimentation rate from 10 cm/ka ? 1 in the Pleistocene to 20 cm/ka ? 1 in the Holocene may account for late buildup of sediments within rock shelters, increased artifact accumulation, and reduced postdepositional disturbance in some settings. More intense use of rock shelters in the Late Holocene is indicated from a change in hunting technology and greater production of rock art. The results indicate that some cultural interpretations might be flawed unless archaeological evidence from rock-shelter and open-site excavations is integrated. ? 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Wasson:1994sediment,"An analysis of 275 estimated sediment yields from Australia shows that regional differences of yield correlate with different variables for different sizes of drainage basin. Despite this scale-dependence, high yields in large streams appear to be the result of high delivery rates from uplands, controlled substantially by rainfall and runoff energy, and the nature of drainage networks. Land use plays a subsidiary role, modulating upland yields. These regional patterns of sediment yield do not in general support conclusions reached by analyses of global data; specifically, altitude is not a useful discriminator óf yield, and the slopes of the regression equations relating yield and basin area do not fit global patterns.

There is no discernible input of top soil from the cleared land adjacent to the Daly River in the study area. The analysis and OSL dating of the alluvial benches have also provided data on the age of (and inferences about the causes of) bench formation, flood frequency change, sedimentation rate change, and episodes of sand transport. The benches are being destroyed as the channel widens (contributing sediment to the river) and the bed of the Daly appears to be shallowing, both responses to increased overbank flows.

The site contains a rich late Holocene deposit, with extensive contact rock art, stone artefacts, shell, bone, contact materials, ancestral human remains, and other cultural material. Excavation of the Malarrak 1 rockshelter and analysis of its sediments revealed many impacts on site formation processes within the deposit. We attribute the disturbance to possible erosion or sediment deposition during periods of intense rainfall and also to the construction of timber structures within the site. This is supported by modern and historical observations and is the focus of this paper. The extent of the disturbance to Malarrak 1 provides a cautionary tale for other excavations in the region that may be affected by similar Indigenous site occupation, as these anthropogenic activities enhance the risk of further impacts arising from biological and geomorphological processes that can impinge on the stratigraphic integrity of the cultural deposits.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wesley:2018wellington,"The archaeology of Bald Rock 1, Bald Rock 2 and Bald Rock 3 at the sandstone outcrop of Maliwawa has established ∼25,000 years of Indigenous occupation in the Wellington Range, northwestern Arnhem Land. Flaked stone artefacts were found from the beginning of the sequence, with ground-edge axes, pounding and grinding technology and ochre recovered from deposits dating from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the recent contact period. Maliwawa was occupied during the LGM and other major regional environmental changes arising from post-glacial sea level rise and stabilisation along with the climatic variability of the Indonesian Australian Summer Monsoon (IASM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), supporting models that define Arnhem Land as a refugium. Lithic assemblages are represented by a quartz and quartzite flake abundance technological strategy, with an unusual lack of stone points observed, although other typical Arnhem Land Holocene retouched lithics are present. Raw material diversity in the late Holocene, alongside a variety of emergent pan-Arnhem Land rock art styles in the Wellington Range, supports the proposition of increasing exchange between Indigenous groups. These changes in the archaeological record signal the expansion of cultural systems throughout western Arnhem Land, documented historically and archaeologically, at the time of culture contact.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

West:2014dilution,"The concentration of 10Be in detrital quartz (10Beqtz) from river sediments is now widely used to quantify catchment-wide denudation rates but may also be sensitive to inputs from bedrock landslides that deliver sediment with low 10Beqtz. Major landslide-triggering events can provide large amounts of low-concentration material to rivers in mountain catchments, but changes in river sediment 10Beqtz due to such events have not yet been measured directly. Here we examine the impact of widespread landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake on 10Beqtz in sediment samples from the Min Jiang river basin, in Sichuan, China. Landslide deposit material associated with the Wenchuan earthquake has consistently lower 10Beqtz than in river sediment prior to the earthquake. River sediment 10Beqtz decreased significantly following the earthquake downstream of areas of high coseismic landslide occurrence (i.e., with greater than ∼0.3\% of the upstream catchment area affected by landslides), because of input of the 10Be-depleted landslide material, but showed no systematic changes where landslide occurrence was low.  ...

West:2015nepal,"Although agriculturally accelerated soil erosion is implicated in the unsustainable environmental degradation of mountain environments, such as in the Himalaya, the effects of land use can be challenging to quantify in many mountain settings because of the high and variable natural background rates of erosion. In this study, we present new long-term denudation rates, derived from cosmogenic 10Be analysis of quartz in river sediment from the Likhu Khola, a small agricultural river basin in the Middle Hills of central Nepal. Calculated long-term denudation rates, which reflect background natural erosion processes over 1000+ years prior to agri- cultural intensification, are similar to present-day sediment yields and to soil loss rates from terraces that are well maintained. Similarity in short- and long-term catchment-wide erosion rates for the Likhu is consistent with data from elsewhere in the Nepal Middle Hills but contrasts with the very large increases in short-term erosion rates seen in agricultural catchments in other steep mountain settings. Our results suggest that the large sediment fluxes exported from the Likhu and other Middle Hills rivers in the Himalaya are derived in large part from natural processes, rather than from soil erosion as a result of agricultural activity. ...

Wheeler:2014chelsea,"Compliance-based test excavations at Chelsea Heights recovered a small number of flaked stone artefacts from a sand body located beneath peat deposits that were identified as part of the former Carrum Swamp. The low elevation of the study area (<2 m ASL) suggests that the upper peat deposits formed following inundation of the coastline during the early- to mid-Holocene (~7 ka) (Lewis et al. 2013), and formed a cap over the artefact-bearing sand deposits. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) age estimates obtained from the sand body indicate that the underlying sands and associated artefacts accumulated between 32 ± 4 ka and 30 ± 3 ka, with burial of the deposit by 10 ± 1 ka. Due to low lithogenic dose rates, additional modelling of the age estimates was undertaken, indicating a more conservative age of artefact deposition at ~25--23 ka, and burial of the sand unit by ~5 ka. Although few artefacts were recovered from the site, and the scope of investigations was limited by the size of the study area, the results suggest that sealed archaeological deposits, which potentially pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), exist beneath the Carrum Swamp peats.

White:1997changing,"This paper argues that obsidian movement in the Bismarck Archipelago at the start of the Lapita period shows continuity with earlier patterns and that changes in sources used occur later than the introduction of ceramics. We base our argument on the analysis of obsidian from two ceramic sites in the Duke of York Islands. The sites contain very differently decorated pottery, but both radiocarbon and obsidian hydration dating show they are very close in time, dating to around 3000 years ago. Density and PIXE-PIGME analysis show that nearly all the obsidian from the putatively older site (SEE), containing ‘classic‘ Lapita, came from West New Britain, mostly the Kutau/Bao sources. The possibly slightly later site (SDP), with very thin walled pottery decorated only by rim notching, was initially supplied exclusively from the Umrei source in the Admiralties, with a subsequent reversion to West New Britain. The first two stages in this history appear to be repeated in the similarly dated sequence from EKQ on Mussau Is. Pre-Lapita data from New Ireland, Nissan and the Papua New Guinea mainland show an extensive distribution of obsid- ian, exclusively using West New Britain sources, while in the same period Admiralty obsidian has not been found beyond the Admiralties. Thus the use of West New Britain sources in the probably oldest Lapita levels in the Duke of Yorks and Mussau suggests continuity in obsidian distribution with the preceding period.

Wilkins:2012comparative,"Sediment core chronologies of optical dates on single-grains/very small aliquots of sand-sized quartz are compared with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon (14C) chronologies from ostracod carbonate, mixed carbonates, sedimentary organic matter and charcoal in order to establish the age of laminated Holocene sediments in maar crater lakes Keilambete and Gnotuk, Victoria, Australia. Samples for optical and AMS 14C dating were taken from the same Mackereth cores, allowing a direct comparison of the two techniques from two laminated sedimentary sequences. Additional AMS 14C samples were taken from water in Lake Keilambete and from groundwater discharging into Lake Keilambete from the crater wall, with equivalent reservoir ages of 150~±~30 and 1940~±~30 years respectively. AMS 14C dating of modern ostracod carbonate in Lake Keilambete demonstrates a reservoir age of 670~±~175 years. Optical dating of 'single-grain/very small aliquots' of sand-sized-quartz indicate the presence of a radiocarbon reservoir in Lake Keilambete that is consistent with that measured on modern ostracods, and also demonstrate that there is no 14C reservoir in Lake Gnotuk during the Holocene. The chronology presented here supports the premise that previously published bulk conventional 14C dates from Lake Keilambete were affected by old carbon, meaning that past chronologies require revision. Limitations on the use of optical dating of single-grain/very small aliquots include the relative paucity of sand-sized quartz, which decreases the precision of the sample equivalent dose (De), and is further confounded by low environmental dose rates and resultant large uncertainties on the final age assessment. Nevertheless, evidence for partial bleaching confirms that single-grain quartz dating is the most appropriate luminescence technique, and may prove a useful alternative in situations where 14C dating is unsuitable or an alternative chronometer is required.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Our results indicate somewhat higher apparent erosion rates at the rangefront (0.41-0.58 mm/yr) when compared to erosion rates incorporating lower-relief sub-catchments at the river outlet (∼0.28 mm/yr).

Willenbring:2013mean,"In equilibrium landscapes, 10Be concentrations within detrital quartz grains are expected to quantitatively reflect basin-wide denudation rates. In transient landscapes, though detrital quartz is derived from both the incising, adjusting lowland and the unadjusted, relict upland, the integrated 10Be concentrations still provide a denudation rate averaged across the two domains. Because field samples can provide only a snapshot of the current upstream-averaged erosion rate, we employ a numerical landscape evolution model to explore how 10Be-derived denudation rates vary over time and space during transient adjustment. Model results suggest that the longitudinal pattern of mean denudation rates is generated by the river’s progressive dilution of low-volume, high-concentration detritus from relict uplands by the integration of high-volume, low-concentration detritus from adjusting lowlands. The proportion of these materials in any detrital sample depends on what fraction of the upstream area remains unadjusted. Because the boundary of the adjusting part of the landscape changes over time, the longitudinal trend in cosmogenic nuclide–derived erosion rates changes over time. These insights are then used to guide our interpretation of geomorphic and longitudinal cosmogenic nuclide data from the South Fork Eel River (SFER) in the California Coast Range (United States).  ...

Williams:1985mound,"Artificially constructed earth mounds are found in a number of areas in Austalia and are associated with wetlands and localities which have a high rainfall and poorly drained soils. Sites range in size from 3m to 100m in diameter and 0.2 to 3 m in height. Previous work suggested that mounds first appeared during the mid to late Holocene. Some authors (e.g. Lourandos 1983: 85-87) see the introduction of mounds as linked to an increase in production in prehistoric economies, or 'intensification'. My Ph.D research comprised a detailed study of mounds in one region, southwestern Victoria. Ethnographic accounts note that mounds here were used for a variety of purposes, including ovens, general camping areas and as foundations for substantial huts. Archaeological work, including survey, excavation, and geochemical and magnetic sampling of sediments, shewed that mounds were used for the above purposes in the prehistoric past. The study confirmed that mounds appear relatively late in the prehistoric sequence, after 2500 yBP. All but one site first appeared after 2000 yBP. This is well after the introduction of certain technological changes such as the 'Australian small tool tradition', which probably entered the region between 4 to 5000 years ago. The appearance of mounds does not appear to be linked with this technological change and mounds instead seem to be part of a sequence of generalised changes in site types and numbers first appearing in the region about 2500 years ago. My research suggests that these changes reflected shifts in a number of aspects of prehistoric societies, including changes in the organisation of camps and the use of labour,and a shift to a more long-term occupation of settlements. At present there is too little information to determine whether only one prime mover was involved. Some authors (e.g. Beaton 1983) maintain that 'population pressure' was the major prime mover, while others (e.g. Lourandos 1983, 1984) argue that changes were caused by shifts in alliance networks, leading to 'intensification'. I believe that both these factors were probably involved and that an environmental shift to a wetter climate about 2000 years ago, also contributed to these changes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Williams:1991episodic,"Throughout the late Quaternary, the central west of New South Wales functioned as a low gradient desert margin system characterised by episodic aeolian, alluvial and lacustrine sedimentation. Aeolian accessions of calcareous dust are reflected in successive episodes of calcium carbonate precipitation within quartz-rich dune, palaeochannel, lake-margin and alluvial fan deposits. The most recent phases of soil formation and calcium carbonate segregation have been radiocarbon dated to 13-16 ka and 21- 33 ka, although this latter phase may comprise at least three distinct sub-phases. Soil formation was followed by erosion and truncation, and was preceded by the accumulation of widespread fluvio-aeolian quartz-rich mantles. During the last glacial maximum (16-18 ka) gypseous lunettes formed locally as a result of deflation from the margins of small closed lake basins which probably operated as regional groundwater windows. The second half of the Holocene saw the widespread formation and reworking of source-bordering linear dunes downwind of seasonal stream channels, and partial burial of the Pleistocene sand plains and dunes by their Holocene successors. Gully incision during the last hundred years may reflect the impact of European settlement and associated changes in fire regime, but could equally be related to changes in drought frequency and the seasonal incidence of rainfall.",2023-09-03 12:38:33.072 +0200,
Williams:1997thesis,"Faunal analysis was undertaken on bones aged approximately 20,000 years to present, from Pamwak Site, Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Grain size analysis of sediments displayed compositional changes through time, which corresponded to changes in human occupation within the site. Taphonomic analysis suggested a mixed mammalian and avian accumulator history for the site, with humans as a bone accumulator for most of the time sequence. The faunal composition of the site changed at 12,000 b. p., with the first appearance of the bandicoot Echimpera kalubu, and the skink Tiliqua sp., and then again at approximately 11,500 b. p. with the first appearance of the cuscus Spilocuscus kraemeri. These changes preceed the first occurrence of obsidian in the site (Fredricksen 1994). Both the faunal composition and taphonomic signatures of the bones, indicate that human occupationof the site intensified after approximately 13,000 b.p.

Williams:2005thesis,"This study reconstructs the palaeoenvironmental history during the last full glacial cycle (approximately the last 75,000 years) at Redhead Lagoon, an enclosed lake basin located in coastal, eastern New South Wales, Australia. This has been achieved primarily through sedimentological, palaeoecological and mineral magnetic analyses of long cores. The sequence adds to the limited number of long-term records in Australia and from this region in particular. The chronology of the sediment record is established through AMS radiocarbon and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. More than 30 AMS radiocarbon ages, using a variety of pre-treatment methods, have been obtained for three cores, which makes this one of the most comprehensively dated lake sediment sequences thus far in Australia. During the initial stages of the last glacial period the site was dominated by a mobile dune system with no permanent water, Supporting only semi-arid vegetation communities. The dune sand was part of a sequence of cliff-top dunes located on nearby Dudley Bluff emplaced by a process of 'sand ramping' during an earlier Pleistocene phase of lower sea level. Pollen analysis indicates that the sequence of vegetation changes seen at Redhead Lagoon broadly compares with the cyclical pattern of climatically induced changes seen in many other pollen records in southeastern Australia. Alternating open herbaceous and woodland/forest communities correspond with glacial and interglacial periods respectively. Superimposed on this pattern is a change towards a more open understorey vegetation assemblage, i.e. increasing values of Poaceae relative to Asteraceae (particularly type B) over the last 35,000 years. A sharp increase in the incidence of Casuarinaceae from the height of the last glacial and its subsequent decline relative to Eucalyptus in the latter stages of the Holocene is evident. While reduced moisture availability may have initially facilitated the expansion of Casuarinaceae, the restriction of Casuarinaceae during earlier arid periods indicates that another factor appears to have been in operation. An examination of changing Chenopodiaceae/Casuarinaceae ratios, an indicator of salt-tolerance, shows that soil salinity may have been a significant contributor to the incidence of Casuarinaceae at Redhead Lagoon. The driest period during the last glacial cycle occurred during MIS 2. A hiatus in one core from 0. 28,000 to 12,000 BP may have been caused by the erosion of sediments during the LGM and late glacial period. However, deposits dating from this period are preserved in a second core. This core indicates the presence of a Casuarinaceae-dominated open sclerophyll woodland in association with grassland and low water balances during the height of the last glacial period. The Holocene marks the start of a period of climatic amelioration. It is characterised by highly organic sediment deposition, an increase in pollen taxa diversity and the disappearance of several colder and/or drier taxa indicators (e.g. Asteraceae type B). The highest water balances in the sequence are attained during the early to mid-Holocene. This is suggested by the development of wet sclerophyll forest and the attainment of maximum values of taxa such as Pomaderris and Melaleuca. There is also a possible switch to a summer rainfall dominated climatic regime during this period. Both microscopic and macroscopic charcoal counting methods have been employed in this study. Importantly, this has allowed the quantitative assessment of the macroscopic charcoal method over a longer time period than previously documented in Australian records. ...

Williams:2006vegetation,"We present a reconstruction of the vegetation history of the last glacial–interglacial cycle (ca. 75 k cal. yr BP–present) at Redhead Lagoon, an enclosed lake basin in coastal, eastern New South Wales, Australia. The sequence of vegetation change at the site is broadly comparable with the pattern of climatically induced changes observed in many other pollen records in southeast Australia. Open woodland–herbland and woodland–forest communities correspond with glacial and interglacial periods respectively, with an additional change towards a more open understorey vegetation assemblage over the last 40,000 yr. The driest conditions appear to have occurred during the height of the last glacial (some time between 30 and 20 k cal. yr BP). This is consistent with other records from southeast Australia, and provides support for a poleward shift in the subtropical anticyclone belt and, less certainly, for the thesis that the Southern Hemisphere westerlies intensified during this period. In marked contrast to most sites in southeast Australia, Casuarinaceae dominates the pollen record through the height of the last glacial period and into the Holocene. The postglacial climatic amelioration is accompanied by the general reappearance of tree pollen in the record, by the disappearance of several open and disturbed environment indicator taxa, by increases in organic sediment deposition and pollen taxon diversity, and by higher water balances. While climate appears to have been the major control on patterns of vegetation change at this site throughout most of the last glacial–interglacial cycle, changes in depositional environment and hydrology have also played a role. Significantly, substantial increases in the rate and magnitude of many indicators of environmental disturbance since European settlement suggest that humans are now the most important mechanism for environmental change.

Williams:2014sydney,"Excavations across a source-bordering dune overlooking the Hawkesbury River in north-west Sydney, Australia, suggest initial occupation of the region by at least 36 ka, with variable but uninterrupted use until the early Holocene; following abandonment, the site was then re-occupied by ∼3 ka. Along with a handful of other sites, the results provide the earliest reliable evidence of permanent regional populations within south-eastern Australia, and support a model in which early colonizers followed the coastal fringe with forays along the main river systems. The evidence is consistent with the demographic model of Williams, 2013 (Proceedings of the Royal Society Series B 280: 20130486), which suggested low, but established regional populations before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a population nadir following the LGM and increasing use of the region from ∼12 to 8 ka. The site exhibits increased use at the onset and peak of the LGM, and provides an example of a cryptic refuge as defined by Smith, 2013 (The Archaeology of Australia's Deserts. Cambridge University Press: New York). Specifically, changing artefact densities and attributes show the site was used repeatedly, but for shorter periods through this time, and suggest it formed one of a series of key localities in a point-to-point (rather than home-base) subsistence strategy. This strategy was maintained until the site's abandonment in the early Holocene, despite changing population and climatic conditions through the Terminal Pleistocene.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Williams:2015indices,"The extent of prehistoric human impact on the environment is a contentious topic in various palaeo-environmental sciences. The long history of humans in Australia and its extensive fire-prone biota makes this continent a key research area for better characterization of prehistoric human--fire interactions. Here we use statistically robust cross-correlation of archaeological radiocarbon data (n = 4102 ages from 1616 sites) and a new synthesis of charcoal records (n = 155 sites) to test for any relationship between people and fire over the last 20,000 years at continental and regional (25--45°S) scales. We find that the statistical correlation between the two datasets is weak at both spatial scales, with short-lived synchronous responses only in the terminal Pleistocene--Holocene transition, at the onset of the mid-Holocene climatic optimum (~ 10--7 ka) and during significant transitions of El Niño Southern Oscillation (~ 5--4 ka and 1.2--0.8 ka). One interpretation of this is that Aboriginal populations were implementing 'fire-stick farming' only intermittently during periods of societal stress resulting from climatic variability. However, the synchronicity of the correlations with climate changes, along with the low populations through much of this time, suggests that both datasets were independently responding to external climatic forcing. Under either scenario, a lack of significant change in the charcoal record implies that there were no long-lasting impacts to the environmental biota, and macro-scale palaeoenvironmental records prior to European colonization largely reflect responses to non-human influences. While we do not discount the possibility of systematic or deliberate manipulation of fire regimes at local spatial scales, we conclude that human control of fire by prehistoric people in Australia is not evident at broad landscape levels. This conclusion contradicts persistent suggestions of Australian-wide land management and the pervasiveness of the impacts of 'fire-stick farming'.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Williams:2020morphology,"Rivers with discontinuous watercourses are part of the spectrum of river diversity. Chain‐of‐ponds types contain irregularly spaced, steep‐sided ponds that are separated by preferential flow paths on swampy valley fill. They often contain endangered ecological communities and are receiving greater attention for conservation and restoration. Very little is known about how these river types form, how they have evolved and how they function. Here we present the Late‐Quaternary evolution of one of the last remaining large‐scale chain‐of‐ponds systems in Australia, the Mulwaree Ponds. The chain‐of‐ponds was fully formed by 4.5 ka, with the position and alignment of the ponds being related to the position of pools of a palaeo‐river that is up to 100 ka old. Contemporary hydrogeomorphic processes are insufficient to create the ponds, but sufficient to maintain and keep them open. The phases of evolution for this chain‐of‐ponds system are synchronous with Late‐Quaternary changes in fluvial activity documented for other rivers in southeastern Australia. The ponds at Mulwaree have significant preservation potential over thousands of years. In the current landscape they are rare forms, providing significant grounds for conservation and protection of their distinctive geodiversity.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Williams:2021population,"We present a synthesis of 14 compliance-based investigations of an archaeologically significant sand body on the banks of the Parramatta River. We find the alluvial deposit initially formed ‚ ~50,000 years ago (50 ka), but with extensive portions reworked between ‚ ~20-5 ka. There is limited evidence of past visitation, with only three excavations having recovered substantive material culture (i.e. > 20 lithics/m2 across small areas, ~35 m2). Following equivocal evidence of visitation prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), these assemblages generally demonstrate: i) widespread ephemeral, but repeated, activity between ‚ ~14-6 ka, dominated by indurated mudstone/tuff/chert raw materials (IMTC) and expedient technologies, overprinted by; ii) more extensive occupation of the landscape in the last few thousand years, with increasingly diverse and complex stone assemblages using heat-treated silcrete and additional raw materials from multiple geological sources. Notably, these two different phases are often found in the same locale, potentially suggesting a long continuity and repeated land use over 14,000 years. This synthesis demonstrates expansion away from cryptic refuges occupied during the LGM along the Hawkesbury-Nepean River corridor (some 40 km west of Parramatta) only occurred several thousand years after the height of this major climatic disruption. This timing is suggestive of a delayed recovery from the LGM and is coincident with changing environmental and sea-level conditions, which may have influenced, or been exploited by, people in the past.

The Hawke's Bay region is disturbed frequently by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, cyclonic storms, droughts and fire. This thesis determines how the vegetation and soil stability have responded to some of these disturbances, through detailed palaeoecological investigations of lake sediment cores. Studies of surface pollen and differential pollen and spore preservation were undertaken to enhance the interpretations made from the palaeoecological record. Because New Zealand has only been settled by Polynesians relatively recently, the effects of natural disturbance on the vegetation and landscape can be assessed under similar climatic conditions to the present, but in the absence of cultural change.

Forests within range of the ignimbrite were destroyed, and forests located up to 170 km east of the vent suffered variable degrees of damage from ashfall. Stands of Pteridium esculentum and other seral taxa flourished immediately after the eruption. Fires occurred during the eruption and continued for several decades after. The degree and nature of vegetation disturbance above the Taupo Tephra varied according to the thickness of ashfall, local topographical features and probably the vigour of the forest.

Before anthropogenic forest clearance in Hawke's Bay, forest composition fluctuated frequently as a result of disturbance from fires, droughts, and a major volcanic eruption. Each natural disturbance, indicated by short-term increases of seral taxa, was followed by complete forest redevelopment. Cyclonic storms were not a major cause of disturbance to lowland podocarp/hardwood forests in the region, nor to the bracken-scrubland vegetation that replaced the forest after clearance.

Forests cleared by fires were rapidly replaced with a bracken fern-scrubland which remained the predominant vegetation until European settlers cleared it away for pasture production in the late 1870s. Deforestation began about 500 calendar years B.P., but proceeded faster in the drier lowlands than in the wetter hill country. When the catchments were covered with either forest or fern-scrubland, soil erosion was minimal because the soil structure was maintained by the network of roots and protected from raindrop impact by a dense canopy. The main effect of storms before European settlement was to transport pulses of mostly riverbank sediment into the lakes. However, after European settlement, soil erosion increased markedly.

The poorly drained Dacrycarpus dacrydioides-dominated alluvial swamp forests were not as vulnerable to fire, and remained on the Gisborne Plains until European drainage and clearance began in the 19th century. In the last 5500 yr B.P., the lowland forests have been disturbed by at least five ashfalls originating from volcanic eruptions in the Central Volcanic Region. Where the terrestrial and marine cores overlap, comparisons of the pollen records show the vegetation changes and taxa present to be comparable. The fire record was not clear in the marine record, as the charcoal curve was diluted with high background levels of reworked charcoal.

Linkages between reconstructed peatland surface moisture and regional forest composition are investigated using redundancy analysis of the forest pollen data constrained with predicted bog water-table depths. Over 32 percent of the pollen data variance can be explained by surface moisture changes in the bog, suggesting a common cause of water-table and regional vegetation change. Water tables were higher during the early to mid-Holocene when the forest was dominated by podocarp taxa. Water tables lowered after about 3300 cal. yr BP coevally with the expansion of Nothofagus species, culminating with the dominance of Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora in the past 1200 cal. yr BP. This is in apparent opposition to the warm/dry to cool/wet trend suggested by subjective interpretation of pollen data alone, from this and other studies.

By using a multi-proxy approach, coupling pyrogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons, the anhydrosugar levoglucosan and traditional charcoal data, this allowed for a distinguishment to be made between low intensity bushfires and high intensity wildfire events. It was shown that since ~4000 cal yr there has been a gradual increase in the frequency of burn events, however in the last 1200 ka, the intensity of bushfires has surged. This project demonstrates that the uninhabitance of Kangaroo Island by Indigenous Australians, along with changes in the influence of ENSO may have contributed to the new fire regime we see today.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Winton:2016weld,"We present the results of radiometric dating at Yalibirri Mindi Rockshelter located in the Weld Range, Mid West region, Western Australia. A sequence of three Pleistocene dates from charcoal found in association with flaked stone artefacts and with a basal date of 29,089 ± 132 years uncal. BP (D-AMS 009920) provides the first evidence for Pre-Last Glacial Maximum occupation of the inland Mid West. Sedimentological analyses strongly support the anthropogenic origin of the dated material. Despite hints that the occupation of this region probably dates back tens of thousands of years, until now there was no clear evidence for this. At the level of regional significance and as previously hypothesised, the greenstone ridges of the Mid West provide good potential for Pleistocene-aged rockshelter deposits and the possibility of researching crucial aspects of human adaptation to the western arid zone of Australia from ∼30,000 years ago including mobility, seasonality, technology, ochre use, selection of wood taxa for fire-making and intra- and inter-regional social networks. ...

Wittmann:2007switzerland,"A north‐south traverse through the Swiss Central Alps reveals that denudation rates correlate with recent rock uplift rates in both magnitude and spatial distribution. This result emerges from a study of in situ–produced cosmogenic 10Be in riverborne quartz in Central Alpine catchments. As a prerequisite, we took care to investigate the potential influence of shielding from cosmic rays due to snow, glaciers, and topographic obstructions; to calculate a possible memory from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciation; and to identify a watershed size that is appropriate for systematic sampling. Mean denudation rates are 0.27 ± 0.14 mm/a for the Alpine foreland and 0.9 ± 0.3 mm/a for the crystalline Central Alps. The measured cosmogenic nuclide‐derived denudation rates are in good agreement with post‐LGM lake infill rates and are about twice as high as denudation rates from apatite fission track ages that record denudation from 9 to 5 Ma. In general, denudation rates are high in areas of high topography and high crustal thickness. The similarity in the spatial distribution and magnitude of denudation rates and those of rock uplift rates can be interpreted in several ways: (1) Postglacial rebound or climate change has introduced a transient change in which both uplift and denudation follow each other with a short lag time; (2) the amplitude of glacial to interglacial changes in both is small and is contained in the scatter of the data; (3) both are driven by ongoing convergence where their similarity might hint at some form of long‐term quasi steady state; or (4) enhanced continuous Quaternary erosion and isostatic compensation of the mass removed accounts for the distribution of present‐day rock uplift.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wittmann:2009source,"The denudation rate signal of the Bolivian Andes as measured by cosmogenic 10Be in sediment is preserved in the floodplain of adjacent foreland basins even though these basins store the sediment for thousands of years. This conclusion is drawn from comparing published Andean source area denudation rates with new cosmogenic 10Be data as measured in the floodplains of the large Beni and Mamoré basins. For the entire Beni basin including the sediment-producing Andes and the vast flooded plains of the foreland, the cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rate is 0.45 ± 0.06 mm/yr, while that of the Mamoré basin is 0.55 ± 0.19 mm/yr. By comparison, the respective Andean source areas erode at averaged rates of 0.37 ± 0.06 mm/yr (upper Beni), and at 0.56 ± 0.09 mm/yr (upper Mamoré). We notice a decrease in variability of denudation rate with increasing spatial scale as small-scale processes are averaged out. Sediment mixing within the floodplain damps scatter of nuclide-derived denudation rates picked up in the source area. On the temporal scale, a remarkable agreement between cosmogenic nuclide-derived rates averaging over a few kiloyears with those from fission track dating averaging over millions of years seems to suggest that cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates capture the long-term erosional characteristics of the mountain belt. The sum of these observations suggests that any sample collected along a river traversing a floodplain will yield the denudation rate of the source area. This finding opens the unique possibility of constraining cosmogenic nuclide-derived paleo-sediment budgets for these large basins as the long-term, spatially-averaged denudation rate signal of the sediment-producing area is preserved in sedimentary archives.

Wittmann:2010amazon,"We use cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates from in situ–produced 10Be in river sediment to determine sediment production rates for the central Amazon River and its major tributaries. Recent developments have shown that this method allows calculating denudation rates in large depositional basins despite intermediate sediment storage, with the result that fluxes of the sediment-producing hinterland can now be linked to those discharged at the basins’ outlet. In rivers of the central Amazonian plain, sediment of finer grain sizes (125–500 μm) yields a weighted cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rate of 0.24 ± 0.02 mm/yr that is comparable to the integrated rate of all main Andean-draining rivers (0.37 ± 0.06 mm/yr), which are the Beni, Napo, Mamoré, Ucayali, and Marañón rivers. Coarser-grained sediment (>500 μm) of central Amazonian rivers is indicative of a source from the tectonically stable cratonic headwaters of the Guyana and Brazilian shields, for which the denudation rate is 0.01–0.02 mm/yr. Respective sediment loads can be calculated by converting these cosmogenic nuclide-derived rates using their sediment-producing areas. For the Amazon River at Óbidos, a sediment production rate of ∼610 Mt/yr results; non-Andean source areas contribute only ∼45 Mt/yr. A comparison with published modern sediment fluxes shows similarities within a factor of ∼2 with an average gauging-derived sediment load of ∼1000 Mt/yr at Óbidos, for example. We attribute this similar trend in cosmogenic versus modern sediment loads first to the absence of long-term deposition within the basin and second to the buffering capability of the large Amazon floodplain. The buffering capability dampens short-term, high-amplitude fluctuations (climatic variability in source areas and anthropogenic soil erosion) by the time the denudation rate signal of the hinterland is transmitted to the outlet of the basin.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

The sediment-producing headwaters to the Napo floodplain are the volcanically active Ecuadorian Andes, which discharge sediment at a cosmogenic nuclide-based denudation rate of 0.49 ± 0.12 mm/yr. This denudation rate was calculated from an average 10Be nuclide concentration of 2.2 ± 0.5 × 104 at/g(Qz) that was measured in bedload-derived quartz. Within the Napo lowlands, a significant drop in trunk stream 10Be nuclide concentrations relative to the Andean hinterland is recorded, with an average concentration of 1.2 ± 0.5 × 104 at/g(Qz). This nuclide concentration represents a mixture between the 10Be nuclide concentration of eroded floodplain deposits, and that of sediment eroded from the Andean hinterland that is now carried in the trunk stream. ...

Wittmann:2016po,"We analyze the source-to-sink variations of in situ 10Be, 26Al and 21Ne concentrations in modern sediment of the Po river catchment, from Alpine, Apennine, floodplain, and delta samples, in order to investigate how the cosmogenic record of orogenic erosion is transmitted across a fast-subsiding foreland basin. The in situ 10Be concentrations in the analyzed samples range from ∼0.8×10^4 at/gQTZ to ∼6.5×10^4 at/gQTZ. The 10Be-derived denudation rates range from 0.1 to 1.5 mm/yr in the Alpine source areas and from 0.3 to 0.5 mm/yr in the Apenninic source areas. The highest 10Be-derived denudation rates are found in the western Central Alps (1.5 mm/yr). From these data, we constrain a sediment flux leaving the Alpine and the Apenninic source areas (>27 Mt/yr and ca. 5 Mt/yr, respectively) that is notably higher than the estimates of sediment export provided by gauging (∼10 Mt/yr at the Po delta).",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wittmann:2020global,"Cosmogenic nuclide analysis in sediment from the Earth's largest rivers yields mean denudation rates of the sediment-producing areas that average out the local variations commonly found in small rivers. Using this approach, we measured in situ cosmogenic 26Al and 10Be in sand of > 50 large rivers over a range of climatic and tectonic regimes covering 32% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. In 35% of the analyzed rivers, we find 26Al/10Be ratios significantly lower than these nuclides ́ surface-production-rate ratio of 6.75 in quartz, indicating radioactive decay over periods exceeding 0.5 Myr. We invoke a combination of slow erosion, shielding in the source area, and sediment storage and burial during long-distance transport to explain these low ratios. In the other 65% of studied rivers we find 26Al/10Be ratios within uncertainty of their surface production-rate ratio, indicating cosmogenic steady state.

Wobus:2005nepalese,"Recent convergence between India and Eurasia is commonly assumed to be accommodated mainly along a single fault—the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT)—which reaches the surface in the Siwalik Hills of southern Nepal. Although this model is consistent with geodetic, geomorphic and microseismic data, an alternative model incorporating slip on more northerly surface faults has been proposed to be consistent with these data as well. Here we present in situ cosmogenic 10Be data indicating a fourfold increase in millennial timescale erosion rates occurring over a distance of less than 2 km in central Nepal, delineating for the first time an active thrust fault nearly 100 km north of the surface expression of the MHT. These data challenge the view that rock uplift gradients in central Nepal reflect only passive transport over a ramp in the MHT. Instead, when combined with previously reported 40Ar–39Ar data9, our results indicate persistent exhumation above deep-seated, surface-breaking structures at the foot of the high Himalaya. These results suggest that strong dynamic interactions between climate, erosion and tectonics have maintained a locus of active deformation well to the north of the Himalayan deformation front.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Woelfler:2017menderes,"Based on new thermochronological data and 10Be-derived erosion rates from the southern part of the central Menderes Massif (Aydın block) in western Turkey, we provide new insights into the tectonic evolution and landscape development of an area that undergoes active continental extension. Fission-track and (U-Th)/He data reveal that the footwall of the Büyük Menderes detachment experienced two episodes of enhanced cooling and exhumation. Assuming an elevated geothermal gradient of ~ 50 °C/km, the first phase occurred with an average rate of ~ 0.90 km/Myr in the middle Miocene and the second one in the latest Miocene and Pliocene with a rate of ~ 0.43 km/Myr. The exhumation rates between these two phases were lower and range from ~ 0.14 to ~ 0.24 km/Myr, depending on the distance to the detachment. Cosmogenic nuclide-based erosion rates for catchments in the Aydın block range from ~ 0.1 to ~ 0.4 km/Myr. The similarity of the erosion rates on both sides of the Aydın block (northern and southern flank) indicate that a rather symmetric erosion pattern has prevailed during the Holocene. If these millennial erosion rates are representative on a million-year timescale they indicate that, apart from normal faulting, erosion in the hanging wall of the Büyük Menderes detachment fault did also contribute to the exhumation of the metamorphic rocks.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wood:2016riwi,"An extensive series of 44 radiocarbon (14C) and 37 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages have been obtained from the site of Riwi, south central Kimberley (NW Australia). As one of the earliest known Pleistocene sites in Australia, with archaeologically sterile sediment beneath deposits containing occupation, the chronology of the site is important in renewed debates surrounding the colonization of Sahul. Charcoal is preserved throughout the sequence and within multiple discrete hearth features. Prior to 14C dating, charcoal has been pretreated with both acid-base-acid (ABA) and acid base oxidation-stepped combustion (ABOx-SC) methods at multiple laboratories. Ages are consistent between laboratories and also between the two pretreatment methods, suggesting that contamination is easily removed from charcoal at Riwi and the Pleistocene ages are likely to be accurate. Whilst some charcoal samples recovered from outside hearth features are identified as outliers within a Bayesian model, all ages on charcoal within hearth features are consistent with stratigraphy. OSL dating has been undertaken using single quartz grains from the sandy matrix. The majority of samples show De distributions that are well-bleached but that also include evidence for mixing as a result of post-depositional bioturbation of the sediment. The results of the two techniques are compared and evaluated within a Bayesian model. Consistency between the two methods is good, and we demonstrate human occupation at this site from 46.4-44.6 cal kBP (95.4% probability range). Importantly, the lowest archaeological horizon at Riwi is underlain by sterile sediments which have been dated by OSL making it possible to demonstrate the absence of human occupation for between 0.9-5.2 ka (68.2% probability range) prior to occupation.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

We contribute new insights into the poorly known Holocene vegetation history of this region by reporting two new mid-late Holocene pollen records from the western (Hallsbush) and eastern (Travis Swamp) margins of the Canterbury Plains. Both records show local forest dominance prior to Polynesian settlement. Forest was cleared rapidly after human settlement at the eastern site, but despite local fires that burnt the wetland the forest was retained at the western site until after European settlement. Together with the few pollen records previously published from the margins of the Canterbury Plains, a clear pattern of beech forest dominance in the west and podocarp/hardwood forest dominance on the plains to the east at the time of human settlement emerges.

Woodward:2005forsyth,"A 1.2 m sediment core from Lake Forsyth, Canterbury, New Zealand, records the development of the catchment/lake system over the last 7000 years, and its response to anthropogenic disturbance following European settlement c. 1840 AD. Pollen was used to reconstruct catchment vegetation history, while foraminifera, chironomids, Trichoptera, and the abundance of Pediastrum simplex colonies were used to infer past environmental conditions within the lake. The basal 30 cm of core records the transition of the Lake Forsyth Basin from a tidal embayment to a brackish coastal lake. Timing of closure of the lake mouth could not be accurately determined, but it appears that Lake Forsyth had stabilised as a slightly brackish, oligo-mesotrophic shallow lake by about 500 years BP. Major deforestation occurred on Banks Peninsula between 1860 AD and 1890 AD. This deforestation is marked by the rapid decline in the main canopy trees (Prumnopitys taxifolia (matai) and Podocarpus totara/hallii (totara/mountain totara), an increase in charcoal, and the appearance of grasses. At around 1895 AD, pine appears in the record while a willow (Salix spp.) appears somewhat later. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of the pollen and aquatic species data revealed a significant relationship between regional vegetation and the abundance of aquatic taxa, with the percentage if disturbance pollen explaining most (14.8 percent) of the constrained variation in the aquatic species data. Principle components analysis (PCA) of aquatic species data revealed that the most significant period of rapid biological change in the lakes history corresponded to the main period of human disturbance in the catchment. Deforestation led to increased sediment and nutrient input into the lake which was accompanied by a major reduction in salinity. These changes are inferred from the appearance and proliferation of freshwater algae (Pediastrum simplex), an increase in abundance and diversity of chironomids, and the abundance of cases and remains from the larvae of the caddisfly, Oecetis unicolor. Eutrophication accompanied by increasing salinity of the lake is inferred from a significant peak and then decline of P. simplex, and a reduction in the abundance and diversity of aquatic invertebrates. The artificial opening of the lake to the Pacific Ocean, which began in the late 1800s, is the likely cause of the recent increase in salinity. An increase in salinity may have also encouraged blooms of the halotolerant and hepatotoxic cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Woodward:2014disturbance,"Lake sediment records from three lakes in the South Island of New Zealand were examined to determine the effects of human (Māori and European) impacts on the lake catchments during the Late Holocene. Major changes in lake biota occurred in the Early to Middle Holocene (11,000--6000 cal. yr BP), but there were no major changes between c. 6000 cal. yr BP and the time of human impact. Intensive Māori forest clearance occurred here between c.ad 1200 and 1600, which is consistent with other New Zealand records. Catchment erosion and increased sedimentation probably occurred in all of the studied lakes, but the most obvious changes occurred in Lake Clearwater and the Māori Lakes. There was evidence for gravity-induced slumping of the littoral sediments in Lake Clearwater due to increased sediment loading, and the outflow from the Māori Lakes was blocked by a migrating alluvial fan. The erosion of sediment (and nutrients) from the lake catchments led to eutrophication, but increases in lake depth were just as important in two of the lakes. Increased water depth was caused by damming of the Māori lakes outflow by a migrating alluvial fan. Reduced evapotranspiration following deforestation would also have led to increased water yield in lake catchments. European impacts were minor compared with the impacts of Māori deforestation, and all lakes display different levels of recovery towards pre-human impact conditions. Complete recovery is prevented by permanent changes in catchment hydrology and probable internal feedback mechanism such as wind-induced sediment re-suspension in the larger lakes.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,
Woodward:2014southeastern,"We present a new well dated Holocene record of environmental change from Little Llangothlin Lagoon in eastern Australia derived from aquatic plant macrofossils, macroscopic charcoal flux, and sediment stratigraphy from multiple cores. Little Llangothlin was an ephemeral freshwater wetland exhibiting frequent dry phases between 9800 and 9300 calendar years before present (cal. yr BP). There was a switch to a more positive water balance after 9300 cal. yr BP, and by 8000 cal. yr BP, there was a lake that persisted until 6100 cal. yr BP. The period between 6100 and 1000 cal. yr BP was much drier, and there is no evidence for a permanent lake during this period. The Little Llangothlin record provides evidence for a wet phase during the Early to Middle Holocene (9000--6000 cal. yr BP) from the boundary region between temperate and tropical influences in eastern Australia. We propose that generally enhanced circulation after 9000 cal. yr BP explains the pattern of increasing moisture at the site at this time. The later Holocene climate at the site is consistent with other sites in south east Australia with a switch to generally drier conditions after 6000 cal. yr BP.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Wray:2001coastal,"Because of its potential for establishing chronologies far beyond the range of C14 thermoluminescence (TL) dating has made a significant contribution to the study of the Quaternary history of many Australian landscapes. But, as the reliability of the technique requires the removal by sunlight of any residual TL from quartz grains during transport, inadequate bleaching may yield ages for depositional events that are too old. Inadequate bleaching often can be detected by the shape of curves showing the ratio of natural TL vs laboratory-induced TL with increasing temperature. We use this technique here, together with C 14 dating and pedogenic evidence, to assess the reliability of TL determinations for alluvium in the valleys of the Clyde River and Termeil Creek. The Pleistocene TL ages from these valleys seem reliable, but Holocene dates do not. However, we demonstrate that, even where inadequate bleaching is demonstrable, TL analysis can still yield important insight to depositional processes.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Wright:1971york,"Man came to Australia well before the end of the Pleistocene epoch - the so-called Ice Age. To understand his history, then, both early and later, calls for an understanding of climate and environment, and the changes that have taken place in them. Early man in Australia was a stone-using huntergatherer, and the traditional Aboriginal economy and society have persisted into modern times, so a wealth of ethnographic information is available to help in understanding the way he reacted and so influenced the diversity of environments found in the Australian continent. Over the last ten years Australian archaeology has developed from a very new branch of an old-established discipline to one that has made and is making very significant contributions to the study of universal man, not just in Australia. This book is the outcome of a series of seminars by scholars in many fields who have brought to bear the skills of many disciplines in interpreting a vast array of challenging new information.

Eleven new radiocarbon dates, combined with nine previous determinations, clarify its site formation processes and settlement history. The sequence shows two sustained settlement periods between 7239-3211 cal. BP and 1815 cal. BP-present, with little evidence for use during the intervening period. This differs from Badu 15, approximately 15 km south of Mabuyag, where human activity became sporadic after 6500 cal. BP.

Wright:2013settlement,"The discovery and initial excavation of Dabangay in 2006 established a 7200 year chronology for human settlement on Mabuyag (Mabuiag) in western Torres Strait. This was one of only two Torres Strait sites to pre-date 4000 years ago, providing a rare opportunity to study human activities spanning the mid-to-late Holocene. Remarkable organic preservation and a large mid-Holocene stone artefact assemblage provided insights into long-term continuity and change in lithic technologies and economic strategies; however, results remained preliminary owing to uncertainties about site disturbance. This paper presents results from a second field season of excavations at Dabangay. We suggest chronological association between emerging lithic technologies and altered subsistence practices. Large marine vertebrate bone (present in small quantities from initial settlement), increased after 4200 years ago coincident with increased preference for production of quartz bipolar flakes. A further development after 1800-1600 years ago involved a substantial increase in large and small marine vertebrates and a further increase in the ratio of quartz to igneous lithics.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
Wright:2016ceremony,"The materiality of ritual performance is a growing focus for archaeologists. In Europe, collective ritual performance is expected to be highly structured and to leave behind a loud archaeological signature. In Australia and Papua New Guinea, ritual is highly structured; however, material signatures for performance are not always apparent, with ritual frequently bound up in the surrounding natural and cultural landscape. One way of assessing long-term ritual in this context is by using archaeology to historicize ethno-historical and ethnographic accounts. Examples of this in the Torres Strait region, islands between Papua New Guinea and mainland Australia, suggest that ritual activities were materially inscribed at kod sites (ceremonial men‘s meeting places) through distribution of clan fireplaces, mounds of stone/bone and shell. This paper examines the structure of Torres Strait ritual for a site ethnographically reputed to be the ancestral kod of the Mabuyag Islanders.  ...

Wright:2018yindayin,"Economic intensification is a prominent concept in hunter-gatherer literature, being used to explain increasing hunter-gatherer complexity and the transition to domestication and permanent settlement. This study used invertebrate material from the Yindayin rockshelter to evaluate whether population driven economic intensification was present during the Holocene. Environmental and climate data was also assessed to evaluate its impact on the observed subsistence patterns. An explanatory model describing the occupation at Yindayin was produced that incorporated the results of the economic intensification assessment, the environmental and climatic data, and data from Beaton’s original analysis of Princess Charlotte Bay.This study did not find a unidirectional increase in occupation during the Holocene. Instead, the results demonstrated that subsistence and occupation patterns at the site were complex and non-linear with periods of increased intensity interspersed with periods of stability and abandonment. Environmental and climate change had the most visible effect on subsistence behaviours while the potential for population induced economic intensification was only identified within the last 200 years of occupation. The results emphasised that interactions between population, environment, and climate are complex, and that to presume there are singular explanations for variation in coastal occupation and subsistence is to deny this complexity. The study demonstrate how economic intensification can be deduced from archaeological correlates and how population driven effects may be separated from environmental effects under certain circumstances. Finally, this study demonstrated how valuable invertebrate assemblages can be for understanding the responses of coastal foragers to environmental and population driven resource pressure.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Wright:2021consecrated,"Religious rituals are a fundamental aspect of being human. They are performed by peoples from around the world and preserved within material and written histories. Archaeologists seek physical traces of these rituals, recognising that this information can provide a window into the life-ways of our modern human ancestors and the way in which rituals transition between sacred places (e.g. Turner 1969). Most research has focused on the ritual performances of world religions (i.e. those that have a global reach, monumental architecture and written scriptures), with ritual passage within Indigenous contexts less well understood. This is despite ethnographic information demonstrating complex and formalised ritual circuits, ancestor trackways and song-lines within these locales. This chapter examines the ethnography and archaeology of ‘Waiet markai,‘ a consecrated journey that involved initiation ceremonies spanning three Eastern Torres Strait (henceforth ETS) islands. Specifically we focus on ‘Ne‘ on Waier, one stage of the ‘Waiet markai‘ and address two questions that emerged within this research: (i) can temporal change be isolated at important ETS Islander ritual places? (ii) Do echoes of the staged Waiet markai process survive in the structure of ceremonies and site architecture? We argue that an integrated approach, drawing on ethnography and archaeology, allows us to better understand ritual processes within Indigenous contexts. Performative models of ritual passage allow us to better understand archaeological and ethnographic anomalies at Ne and move beyond universal conceptions of sacred sites as ritual isolates.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200
WrightNeville:2013cotters,"Recent archaeological investigations at Cotters Beach, Wilsons Promontory, have presented the opportunity to build upon existing knowledge about coastal Aboriginal places in this area. The archaeological material at Cotters Beach is exposed in two different depositional contexts: in cliff faces along the foreshore, and on the sandy surfaces of dune blowouts located behind the foredunes. This permits the investigation and comparison of recently exposed cultural material to material identified during previous archaeological investigations. The recent archaeological investigations involved the characterisation of shell midden and other archaeological material identified on the surface of a deflated dune blowout, and the investigation of the chronological relationship between this material and other cultural remains exposed in cliff faces through AMS dating. The data collected from the dune blowout at Cotters Beach was then compared with information generated from studies of dune blowouts and cliffs along the Yanakie West coastline by Peter Coutts in the 1960s. It was also compared to Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Register Aboriginal place card information, which was collected as part of the Operation Raleigh project undertaken by the Victorian Archaeological Survey in 1987. Overall, the results of documentary research and fieldwork undertaken at Cotters Beach are similar, and support Coutts' findings that the archaeological material in this area reflects three occupational phases, with cliff occupation occurring earlier than dune occupation. The results also support the interpretation that the presence of both sandy beach and rocky platform shellfish species reflects different environmental conditions.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Wurster:2021impacts,"Fire is an essential component of tropical savannas, driving key ecological feedbacks and functions. Indigenous manipulation of fire has been practiced for tens of millennia in Australian savannas, and there is a renewed interest in understanding the effects of anthropogenic burning on savanna systems. However, separating the impacts of natural and human fire regimes on millennial timescales remains difficult. Here we show using palynological and isotope geochemical proxy records from a rare permanent water body in Northern Australia that vegetation, climate, and fire dynamics were intimately linked over the early to mid-Holocene. As the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) intensified during the late Holocene, a decoupling occurred between fire intensity and frequency, landscape vegetation, and the source of vegetation burnt. We infer from this decoupling, that indigenous fire management began or intensified at around 3 cal kyr BP, possibly as a response to ENSO related climate variability. Indigenous fire management reduced fire intensity and targeted understory tropical grasses, enabling woody thickening to continue in a drying climate.",2023-07-28 11:01:26.780 +0200,

Using stomach content analysis of 73 feral cats from semi-arid grassland habitats in Queensland, Australia, we aimed to identify dominant prey groups in the cats' diet and to explore associations between the diversity of prey eaten and attributes of the cats including body size, condition, sex, age and coat colour. We also sought to determine any relationships between cat size and the size of the dominant prey in the diet, the long-haired rat Rattus villosissimus. Mammals and reptiles were the dominant prey, with R. villosissimus occurring in 60 % of samples and comprising more than half of all prey by volume. Birds and terrestrial invertebrates were the next most important contributors to the diet, but fish, frogs and freshwater crustaceans also were surprisingly well represented. The dietary diversity of cats was largely unrelated to any of the cat attributes that we measured, although a positive relationship emerged between cat head width and the range of prey types eaten. Our study was conducted during a population irruption of R. villosissimus and confirms that cats are able to exploit an abundant focal prey resource when the opportunity occurs.

A small number of the grains examined are strongly luminescent and saturate at unusually high doses. These 'supergrains' may permit reliable age determination to 1 Ma, and possibly beyond. Some other grains are in, or close to, dose-saturation, so that only minimum age estimates may be obtained. Most of the grains examined are very weakly luminescent and have palaeodoses much less than expected, while the palaeodoses of some grains cannot be estimated because of anomalous dose-response characteristics.

Young:1996shoalhaven,"New research from the Shoalhaven deltaic plain prompts revision of ideas on fluvial deposition in coastal New South Wales. Extensive remnants of Pleistocene alluvium occur on the surface and beneath Holocene sediments. Thermoluminescence (TL) analysis indicates that there were at least two and probably four phases of Pleistocene deposition spanning much of Last Interglacial and Glacial times. Deposition continued even when sea levels were low. Holocene infilling was faster than previously thought, for the Shoalhaven was feeding fluvial sand onto the shore and the adjacent barrier dune system by 6 ka. Away from the main channel, deposition occurred mainly as levee building along tributary and distributary channels. Claims for an initial southerly course of the Shoalhaven across the plain followed by avulsion northward to the present mouth are discounted. Channels flowing southward are too small to be former courses of the Shoalhaven, and are better explained as distributaries caused by crevassing of levees. A terrace sequence includes bedrock straths of possible Tertiary age, eroded Pleistocene remnants, and three main Holocene levels apparently linked to falling sea levels. Alluvium was stripped and fluvial channels truncated by tsunami surges up estuaries. Tsunami impact is also indicated by relic boulder and sand deposits.

Thermoluminescence dating demonstrates that the oldest palaeochannels of the Namoi River correspond only to the youngest palaeochannels on the Riverine Plain. Unlike the streams on the Riverine Plain, the Namoi River has moved progressively away from its buried Tertiary palaeovalley, probably due to declining sediment input from its southern tributaries. In contrast to the streams of the Riverine Plain, the dimensions of the Namoi palaeochannels are indicative of substantially greater discharges until the mid-Holocene. There is also evidence of significant aeolian input throughout the Late Quaternary.

This PhD project analyses surface sediments and modern plant samples from the main areas of the northern and southern marshes to assess the most appropriate proxies to be applied to sediment cores to reveal the 'condition' of the MM. Four cores from the northern marshes where organic matter was better preserved were chosen to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental history of the marshes. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) single-grain dating was applied to obtain the chronology; lipid biomarkers particularly n-alkanes and alpha-phellandrene were analysed to trace the vegetation change in the marshes. The palaeoenvironmental history of MM in the past ~ 50 ka is reconstructed: the site where the modern Marshes are likely had been inundated since the late Pleistocene and experienced oscillations of dry/wet climate which in turn led to the change of water level and in response the variation of the vegetation types and abundances. The abundance of wetland plants was probably highest during the establishment of the marshes 8-6 ka ago. A dry period at about 2 ka is shown by C4 drought-tolerant plants. It is not until after European arrival (from the 1880s) that terrestrial plants started intruding and gradually replacing the wetland plants. The most striking shift of aquatic wetland plants to more terrestrial plants in this ecosystem occurred in the 1950s to 1970s due to water diversion after the construction of upstream dams. Compared to natural environmental changes, anthropogenic effects have a greater and irreversible impact on the well-being of the marshes. The fact that the MM are free from anthropogenic pollutants (i.e. pesticides from cotton farming and faecal contaminant from the grazing industry) indicates that water loss, rather than pollutants, is the main cause of the decline of the wetlands.",2021-11-19 12:11:05.011 +0100,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

Zandberg:2021complete,"The Common Rock Rat Zyzomys argurus is an abundant small- to medium-sized Murid rodent that is endemic to Australia. It is a nocturnal mammal with a mostly herbivorous diet. This species is native to the wet/dry tropics of Northern Australia and can be identified from other rock rats on the basis of its small size and its tail length (which is at least equivalent to its head-body length). Here, we describe the complete mitochondrial genome of Z. argurus and compare it to other Rodentia. The Z. argurus circular mitogenome was 16,261 bp and contained 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNAs and a control region (D-loop) of 859 bp. Phylogenetic analysis of selected, published sequenced mitogenomes reveal it is most closely related to the Lakeland Downs mouse Leggadina lakedownensis in the order Rodentia.",2023-02-17 13:35:53.701 +0100,

Zhang:2021paired,"Quantifying erosion rates over various spatial and temporal scales across the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding mountains is crucial to understanding the topographic evolution of the orogen. In this work, we report a new dataset of 10Be-derived basin-wide erosion rates from the main tributaries and streams draining the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. The 22 basin-wide erosion rates ranged from 78 ± 7 m Myear−1 to 3,490 ± 612 m Myear−1 across the study area. 26Al was contemporarily measured to evaluate the impact of sediment storage and non-steady-state erosion processes in the syntaxis region. ...

Zhang:2022plateau,"Investigating topographic and climatic controls on erosion at variable spatial and temporal scales is essential to our understanding of the topographic evolution of the orogen. In this work, we quantified millennial-scale erosion rates deduced from cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations in 15 fluvial sediments from the mainstream and major tributaries of the Yarlung Zangbo River draining the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP). The measured ratios of 26Al/10Be range from 6.33 ± 0.29 to 8.96 ± 0.37, suggesting steady-state erosion processes. The resulted erosion rates vary from 20.60 ± 1.79 to 154.00 ± 13.60 m Myr−1, being spatially low in the upstream areas of the Gyaca knickpoint and high in the downstream areas. By examining the relationships between the erosion rate and topographic or climatic indices, we found that both topography and climate play significant roles in the erosion process for basins in the upstream areas of the Gyaca knickpoint. However, topography dominantly controls the erosion processes in the downstream areas of the Gyaca knickpoint, whereas variations in precipitation have only a second-order control. The marginal Himalayas and the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB) yielded significantly higher erosion rates than the central plateau, which indicated that the landscape of the central plateau surface is remarkably stable and is being intensively consumed at its boundaries through river headward erosion. In addition, our 10Be erosion rates are comparable to present-day hydrologic erosion rates in most cases, suggesting either weak human activities or long-term steady-state erosion in this area.",2022-07-10 16:01:09.673 +0200,2022-07-10 14:04:40.403 +0200

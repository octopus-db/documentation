**OCTOPUS** (`https://octopusdata.org <https://octopusdata.org>`_) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database that allows users to visualise, query, and download cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, luminescence, and radiocarbon ages and denudation rates associated with erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms and archaeological records, along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

OCTOPUS is non-commercial, non-profit, and least restrictively licensed. The main purpose of OCTOPUS is the sustainment, upcycling and public provisioning of valuable legacy data that would otherwise be lost to the research community. Beyond research, the promotion and implementation of Indigenous self-management, public training and education are declared OCTOPUS focus target scopes.

OCTOPUS database documentation, so far, was distributed across several internet sources of which OCTOPUS Zenodo community repository (https://zenodo.org/communities/octopus-database/) stores the majority of information, i.e., **OCTOPUS Database v.2: Database field description tables** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352827), **OCTOPUS Database v.2: Relational database schema and documentation** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352807), **OCTOPUS Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Interface User Guides** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7063533, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6469039). Various **Collection descriptions** exist elsewhere. The above documentation will be transferred to https://readthedocs.org/projects/octopus-database/ because usage will be more convenient for users and Git-based versioning allows for hassle-free and secure database documentation.

**OCTOPUS** (`https://octopusdata.org <https://octopusdata.org>`_) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database that allows users to visualise, query, and download cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, luminescence, and radiocarbon ages and denudation rates associated with erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms and archaeological records, along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

OCTOPUS is *non-commercial, non-profit, and least restrictively licensed*. The main purpose of the database is the sustainment, upcycling and public provisioning of valuable legacy data that would otherwise be lost to the research community. Beyond research, the promotion and implementation of Indigenous self-management, public training and education are declared OCTOPUS focus target scopes.

An informative OCTOPUS database *Relational Database Schema* can be inspected and downloaded via Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7352807).
